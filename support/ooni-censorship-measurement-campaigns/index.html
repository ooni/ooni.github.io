The abrupt emergence of new blocks requires rapid response in terms of measurement, particularly if the blocks are short-lived. Such measurement can help with the collection of data that can potentially serve as evidence of internet censorship, supporting the efforts of journalists, researchers, and human rights defenders challenging the blocks.</p><p>Detecting sudden or expected blocks can be achieved through <strong>community coordination</strong> on censorship measurement.</p><p>This documentation explains how you can organize <strong>OONI censorship measurement campaigns</strong> with your communities.</p><ul><li><p><a href=/support/ooni-censorship-measurement-campaigns/#what-are-ooni-censorship-measurement-campaigns>What are OONI censorship measurement campaigns?</a></p></li><li><p><a href=/support/ooni-censorship-measurement-campaigns/#why-run-ooni-censorship-measurement-campaigns>Why run OONI censorship measurement campaigns?</a></p></li><li><p><a href=/support/ooni-censorship-measurement-campaigns/#examples-of-ooni-censorship-measurement-campaigns>Examples of OONI censorship measurement campaigns</a></p></li><li><p><a href=/support/ooni-censorship-measurement-campaigns/#how-to-run-an-ooni-censorship-measurement-campaign>How to run an OONI censorship measurement campaign</a></p></li></ul><h3 id=what-are-ooni-censorship-measurement-campaigns>What are OONI censorship measurement campaigns?</h3><p>OONI censorship measurement campaigns are <strong>community-coordinated efforts aimed at measuring the blocking of specific websites</strong> through the use of <a href=https://ooni.org/install/>OONI Probe</a>.</p><p>Specifically, community members use the <a href=https://run.ooni.org/>OONI Run</a> platform to generate mobile deep links based on the specific website(s) that they want to measure for censorship. These links are shared with their community of volunteers (who are <a href=https://ooni.org/install/mobile>OONI Probe mobile app</a> users) in their country, region, or elsewhere in the world. Their community uses these links to test the website(s), contributing measurements that are published as <a href=https://ooni.org/data/>open data</a> in real-time.</p><p>Generally, the goal of OONI censorship measurement campaigns is to <strong>rapidly collect (and publish) data in response to emergent censorship events</strong>.</p><p>Community members often run such campaigns <a href=https://sinarproject.org/digital-rights/measuring-and-detecting-network-interference/ge15>leading up to and during an election</a>, or in response to emergent new blocks during protests or other political events. Sometimes, researchers coordinate with communities of <a href=https://ooni.org/install/mobile>OONI Probe</a> volunteers for the testing of their custom lists of websites.</p><h3 id=why-run-ooni-censorship-measurement-campaigns>Why run OONI censorship measurement campaigns?</h3><p>Censorship events tend to <a href=https://ooni.org/documents/2022-ooni-submission-ohchr-report-internet-shutdowns.pdf>emerge during political events</a>, such as elections or protests. Such blocks are often short-lived (for example, limited to election day), enabling governments to potentially seek plausible deniability.</p><p>Rapidly measuring such blocks – and collecting data that can serve as evidence – is therefore necessary.</p><p>However, if you run <a href=https://ooni.org/install/>OONI Probe</a>, you are only performing tests on the network that you’re connected to. This means that you cannot measure censorship implemented on different networks or in different countries. If you use a VPN or VPS for remote testing, your measurements will not be as accurate as if run directly inside the intended country.</p><p>By running an OONI censorship measurement campaign, you can coordinate with other <a href=https://ooni.org/install/>OONI Probe</a> users (who are in the country or connected to the networks where the blocks are reported or suspected) to <strong>ensure that specific websites are rapidly measured</strong>, and that relevant data (which may serve as evidence) is <a href=https://ooni.org/data/>openly published</a> in real-time. Such <a href=https://ooni.org/data/>data</a> can support <strong>research and advocacy efforts</strong> investigating the blocks.</p><h3 id=examples-of-ooni-censorship-measurement-campaigns>Examples of OONI censorship measurement campaigns</h3><p>Over the years, internet freedom community members have coordinated OONI censorship measurement campaigns in support of their research and advocacy efforts.</p><p>For example, <a href=https://sinarproject.org/>Sinar Project</a> coordinated an <a href=https://sinarproject.org/digital-rights/measuring-and-detecting-network-interference/ge15>OONI censorship measurement campaign in Malaysia</a> to encourage the testing of election-related websites during the country’s 2022 general election. As part of this, they published a <a href=https://sinarproject.org/digital-rights/measuring-and-detecting-network-interference/ge15>Call to Action</a> with OONI Probe testing instructions and the following <a href=https://run.ooni.org/>OONI Run</a> widgets embedded into their website.</p><div><a href=/support/ooni-censorship-measurement-campaigns/images/image3.png><img src=/support/ooni-censorship-measurement-campaigns/images/image3_hu14151368031529591903.png></a></div><p><strong>Image:</strong> Call to Action for OONI Probe testing of election-related websites during Malaysia&rsquo;s 2022 general election (source: <a href=https://sinarproject.org/digital-rights/measuring-and-detecting-network-interference/ge15>Sinar Project</a>).</p><p>India’s <a href=https://sflc.in/>Software Freedom Law Centre (SFLC.in)</a> embedded OONI Run widgets into their <a href=https://internetshutdowns.in/>India Internet Shutdown Tracker project</a> website, encouraging long-term OONI Probe testing of news media, blogs, human rights, and political websites in India.</p><div><a href=/support/ooni-censorship-measurement-campaigns/images/image4.png><img src=/support/ooni-censorship-measurement-campaigns/images/image4_hu17679611726808121432.png></a></div><p><strong>Image:</strong> Call to Action for OONI Probe testing of news media, blogs, human rights, and political websites in India (source: <a href=https://internetshutdowns.in/>SFLC.in</a>).</p><p>Over the years, <a href=https://conexionsegura.org/>Conexión Segura y Libre</a> coordinated with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDvVfjJ0Iq8">OONI Probe volunteers in different regions of Venezuela</a> to measure (and respond to) <a href=https://vesinfiltro.com/>temporary website blocks</a> which emerged in correlation with political events. Human rights advocates from the global <a href=https://www.accessnow.org/keepiton/>#KeepItOn campaign</a> coordinated OONI censorship measurement campaigns leading up to and during political events (such as elections and protests), using OONI data to support their advocacy efforts in response to emergent censorship events.</p><p>Community members have also run OONI censorship measurement campaigns for research purposes. <a href=https://medium.com/@cyberlabukraine>Digital Security Lab Ukraine</a>, for example, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIn-r6JxdEM">coordinated with OONI Probe volunteers in different regions of Ukraine</a> to examine how internet censorship differs from region to region (and network to network) in the country. OTF Information Controls research fellows, Igor Valentovitch and Ksenia Ermoshina, <a href=https://www.opentech.fund/news/exploring-online-media-filtering-during-2018-russian-presidential-elections/>investigated and compared internet censorship in Russia and Crimea</a> during Russia’s 2018 presidential election by coordinating with OONI Probe communities for the testing of their custom lists of websites.</p><h3 id=how-to-run-an-ooni-censorship-measurement-campaign>How to run an OONI censorship measurement campaign</h3><p>To organize your own OONI censorship measurement campaign:</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Determine the <strong>question(s)</strong> that you would like to investigate through your campaign.</p><p>Such questions help inform the timing and location of the campaign, the types of websites that would need to be tested, and other relevant factors that will help inform the design of your campaign.</p><p>For example, if you’re concerned about new censorship events emerging during Cambodia’s 2023 general election, a relevant question could be:</p><p>“Are election-monitoring and political opposition websites accessible in Cambodia during the country’s 2023 general election?”</p><p>Based on the above question, you would need to:</p><ul><li>Engage <a href=https://ooni.org/install/>OONI Probe</a> users in Cambodia for website testing:<ul><li>You can encourage them to take the <a href=https://advocacyassembly.org/en/courses/63/#/chapter/1/lesson/1>online OONI training course</a>;</li><li>Please communicate that censorship measurement is <a href=https://ooni.org/about/risks/>potentially risky</a>;</li></ul></li><li>Determine <em>which election-monitoring and political opposition websites</em> you would like OONI Probe users in Cambodia to test;</li><li>Ensure that the testing is carried out during Cambodia’s 2023 elections (July 2023).</li></ul><p><strong>Note:</strong> Internet censorship is <strong>often limited to specific networks or regions</strong> within a country. You would therefore (ideally) engage OONI Probe users connected to as many networks and in as many regions in a country as possible. Depending on where internet censorship is reported, you may need to coordinate with people to run OONI Probe in those regions.</p><p>When determining the question(s) that will inform your campaign, it’s also worth determining your campaign goals (and relevant outputs, such as the publication of research).</p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Determine <strong>which website(s)</strong> you would like to test for censorship.</p><p>This step may require some research to determine the specific URLs that you would like to measure for censorship. For example, if you’re interested in monitoring political opposition websites in Cambodia, you may need to start off by carrying out some desk research to identify those sites. It may also be worth reaching out to local experts, asking for website testing recommendations.</p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> <strong>Save yourlist of websites in a text editor</strong>, where each URL is in a separate line. You do not need to separate URLs by commas or in any other way.</p><div><a href=/support/ooni-censorship-measurement-campaigns/images/image5.png><img src=/support/ooni-censorship-measurement-campaigns/images/image5_hu11339839380854374064.png></a></div><p><strong>Important:</strong> Please ensure that each <a href=https://ooni.org/support/glossary/#url>URL</a> is typed correctly. If it is mis-typed, <a href=https://ooni.org/install/mobile>OONI Probe</a> will not test the intended website and this will potentially lead to inaccurate test results.</p><p>A few things to keep in mind:</p><ul><li>Is the website on <strong>HTTP</strong> or <strong>HTTPS</strong>? If the latter, please add an extra <code>s</code> after <code>http</code>.</li><li>Does the <a href=https://ooni.org/support/glossary/#domain-name>domain</a> include <code>www</code>? If so, please include it.</li><li>If the website is on HTTPS (e.g <code>https://www.hrw.org/</code>), you don’t need to specify a webpage (e.g <code>https://www.hrw.org/publications</code>), since ISPs usually cannot limit blocking to a specific webpage when it’s hosted on HTTPS. Rather, they would have to block access to the entire website.</li></ul><p>To ensure that each <a href=https://ooni.org/support/glossary/#url>URL</a> is typed accurately, please <strong>copy-paste it from a browser</strong>.</p><p><strong>Optional, but encouraged:</strong> If some of the websites that you’re using for your measurement campaign are relevant for country-wide or worldwide testing, please propose them for the lists of websites ("<a href=https://ooni.org/get-involved/contribute-test-lists>test lists</a>") tested by all OONI Probe users. You can do so through our <a href=https://ooni.org/support/test-lists-editor>Test Lists Editor</a>.</p><p><strong>Step 4.</strong> <strong>Copy</strong> your list of URLs (from your text editor).</p><p><strong>Step 5.</strong> Visit the OONI Run website: <a href=https://run.ooni.org/>https://run.ooni.org/</a></p><div><a href=/support/ooni-censorship-measurement-campaigns/images/image11.png><img src=/support/ooni-censorship-measurement-campaigns/images/image11_hu15187409902815389569.png></a></div><p><strong>Step 6.
