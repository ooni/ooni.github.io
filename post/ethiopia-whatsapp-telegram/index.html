The government had to cancel the exam and organize a fresh one in a month’s time. It is during this second exam that <a href=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/07/ethiopia-blocks-social-media-sites-exam-leak-160711183939642.html>access to online social media was blocked in the country</a> to evidently avoid a repeat of the leakage.</p><p>Amid a wave of protests by ethnic groups, the <a href=https://ooni.io/post/ethiopia-internet-shutdown-amidst-recent-protests/>internet was again shut down completely</a> in August 2016. In collaboration with <a href=https://www.amnesty.org/en/>Amnesty International</a>, we published a <a href=https://ooni.io/post/ethiopia-report/>research report</a> which documented the <a href=https://ooni.io/post/ethiopia-report/#whatsapp-blocked>blocking of WhatsApp</a> and of <a href=https://ooni.io/post/ethiopia-report/#media-outlets>numerous local media websites</a> during these persistent protests. The blocks also included <a href=https://ooni.io/post/ethiopia-report/#political-opposition-and-armed-groups>political opposition</a>, <a href=https://ooni.io/post/ethiopia-report/#lgbti-websites>LGBTQI</a>, <a href=https://ooni.io/post/ethiopia-report/#human-rights-websites>human rights</a>, and <a href=https://ooni.io/post/ethiopia-report/#censorship-circumvention-tool-websites>circumvention tool</a> sites.</p><p>In 2017, Ethiopia <a href=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ethopia-internet/ethiopia-cuts-off-internet-after-high-school-exam-leaks-idUSKBN18S535>shut down the internet just before the planned national high school exams</a> evidently informed by the 2016 leakage. During the 2018 national exams week, there were no known instances of internet disruptions, a clear departure from a practice which was gaining traction - national exams as moments of internet disruptions.</p><p>While last week’s censorship events are <a href=https://www.africanews.com/2019/06/14/ethiopia-internet-blackout-enters-third-day-authorities-remain-mum//>quite similar</a> to previous attempts to curb cheating during national exams, they probably mark the first time that access to social media is blocked nationally in Ethiopia under the leadership of a <a href=https://edition.cnn.com/2018/04/02/africa/ethiopia-new-pm-abiy-ahmed/index.html>new Prime Minister</a>, Abiy Ahmed. His government is widely <a href=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-43567007>regarded</a> as promising a relatively open society, and a host of reforms on expression and access to information have been introduced, including the <a href=http://www.africanews.com/2018/06/23/ethiopia-unblocks-264-websites-and-tv-channels//>reported unblocking of 264 websites</a>. In collaboration with <a href=https://www.accessnow.org/>Access Now</a>, we conducted a <a href=https://ooni.io/post/ethiopia-unblocking/>study</a> to collect network measurements and we were able to <a href=https://ooni.io/post/ethiopia-unblocking/>confirm the unblocking of almost all the websites that we previously found to be blocked</a> in Ethiopia.</p><p>The recent internet disruptions in Ethiopia buck the current government’s public trend on <a href=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/08/abiy-ahmed-upending-ethiopian-politics>reforms</a>.

All measurements collected by <a href=https://ooni.io/install/>OONI Probe</a> users running this test are <a href=https://explorer.ooni.io/country/ET>openly published</a> every day.</p><p>An analysis of <a href=https://explorer.ooni.io/country/ET>OONI WhatsApp measurements</a> collected over the last month reveals that WhatsApp’s registration service and web version (web.whatsapp.com) were blocked in Ethiopia between 12th to 17th June 2019, but WhatsApp’s mobile app was not blocked.</p><p>It’s quite unclear when exactly the blocking of WhatsApp started on 12th June 2019, as only <a href=https://explorer.ooni.io/measurement/20190612T155709Z_AS24757_lPXNcOTMFF3neBU3TSILtWMyPr9M8sVfJ2CD1rr3MaxlOJW7b9>one measurement</a> was collected on that day (at 15:56 UTC).

No further OONI measurements were collected until 15th June 2019, most likely due to the <a href="https://ioda.caida.org/ioda/dashboard#view=inspect&amp;entity=country/ET&amp;lastView=overview&amp;from=1560166834&amp;until=now">internet blackout that followed until 14th June 2019</a>.</p><p>Once internet access was restored, <a href=https://ooni.io/install/>OONI Probe</a> users in Ethiopia performed tests and <a href=https://web.archive.org/web/20190619132827/https:/twitter.com/AtnafB/status/1140018473994719233>shared</a> their findings on Twitter.</p><p><img src=/post/ethiopia-whatsapp-telegram/atnaf-tweet.png alt></p><p><strong>Source:</strong> Tweet by Atnaf Brhane: <a href=https://web.archive.org/web/20190619132827/https:/twitter.com/AtnafB/status/1140018473994719233>https://web.archive.org/web/20190619132827/https:/twitter.com/AtnafB/status/1140018473994719233</a>  </p><p>All OONI WhatsApp measurements collected between <a href=https://explorer.ooni.io/measurement/20190615T070253Z_AS24757_gRi6dhAqgWa7Yp4tah4LX6Rl1j6c8kJuja3OgZranEpMicEj2p>15th June 2019</a> (at 07:00 UTC) to <a href=https://explorer.ooni.io/measurement/20190617T094036Z_AS24757_0J9kMVRFY0P4pA88FLyZGFHCprYq9SLP8915CTT8E9qE4a6xQl>17th June 2019</a> (at 09:40 UTC) consistently suggested blocking of WhatsApp’s registration service and web version (web.whatsapp.com), as illustrated below.</p><p><img src=/post/ethiopia-whatsapp-telegram/WhatsAppBlockingEthiopia.png alt></p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href=https://explorer.ooni.io/country/ET>OONI measurements: Ethiopia</a> (<a href=/post/ethiopia-whatsapp-telegram/20190617-ethiopia-whatsapp.csv>CSV data</a>)</p><p>However, the block does not appear to have been implemented very reliably, as a <a href=https://explorer.ooni.io/measurement/20190615T081631Z_AS24757_NafA1DQMRQl69tAO5TF1jggGpK4q0PDYVqFR8df4sufOlYyi31>request went through at 08:16 UTC on 15th June 2019</a>.

</code></pre><h1 id=blocking-of-telegram>Blocking of Telegram</h1><p>Telegram is one of the <a href=https://qz.com/africa/1214381/in-a-continent-dominated-by-whatsapp-ethiopia-says-yes-to-telegram/>most popular</a> communication platforms in Ethiopia, more than WhatsApp and Viber.</p><p>Once internet access was restored in Ethiopia by 15th June 2019, <a href=https://explorer.ooni.io/measurement/20190615T065831Z_AS24757_wsEXheNmLVO9uauDWpx5sEdZm5KuZxyrB4TLUwJxunvAm5oMY7>Telegram was blocked</a> along with WhatsApp. <a href=https://ooni.io/install/>OONI Probe</a> users measured the blocking of Telegram in Ethiopia as well.</p><p><a href=https://ooni.io/nettest/telegram/>OONI’s Telegram test</a> is designed to measure the reachability of Telegram’s mobile app and web version (web.telegram.org) by attempting to perform an HTTP POST request, TCP connection, and HTTP GET request to Telegram’s endpoints and web version over the vantage point of the user.</p><p>The following chart illustrates that most measurements collected between 12th to 18th June 2019 showed blocking of Telegram’s endpoints, suggesting that Ethio Telecom attempted to block access to the Telegram mobile app.</p><p><img src=/post/ethiopia-whatsapp-telegram/TelegramBlockingEthiopia.png alt></p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href=https://explorer.ooni.io/country/ET>OONI measurements: Ethiopia</a> (<a href=/post/ethiopia-whatsapp-telegram/20190619-ethiopia-telegram.csv>CSV data</a>)</p><p>It’s worth noting though that not all Telegram endpoints were blocked. OONI measurements show that while most connections to Telegram endpoints failed, some were successful. Out of 10 Telegram IPs that were measured, we found that connections to 8 of them were consistently blocked, while connections to 2 Telegram IPs were consistently successful throughout all testing. This pattern suggests that Ethio Telecom may have blocked a static list of Telegram IPs.</p><p>That said, it’s worth acknowledging that the testing was limited to the hardcoded IPs used by the Telegram desktop app and, therefore, may not reflect entirely what was experienced by Telegram mobile app users in Ethiopia over the past week. It is evident though from the testing that there were attempts at disrupting the availability of the Telegram mobile app.</p><p>While it’s quite unclear how successful the blocking of the Telegram mobile app was in practice, the relatively high volume of failed attempts to establish TCP connections to Telegram endpoints strongly suggests that Ethio Telecom attempted to block the app over the last week (and that it, therefore, was probably inaccessible for many users in Ethiopia).</p><p>Telegram Web (web.telegram.org) also appeared to not work as expected. In order to determine if this HTTPS service was blocked in the same way as WhatsApp Web, we ran a series of custom <a href=https://curl.haxx.se/>curl</a> experiments to check for SNI filtering.</p><p>We did not notice any sort of SNI based filtering when accessing the Telegram web interface (web.telegram.org):</p><pre><code>$ curl -v --connect-to ::kernel.org: https://web.telegram.org

If it was blocked intentionally though, Ethio Telecom would have likely added web.telegram.org to their SNI filtering list (similarly to how they blocked access to web.whatsapp.com) to obtain much higher blocking accuracy (in comparison to the IP blocking of the site).</p><p>Our experiments therefore suggest that Telegram Web (web.telegram.org) was probably not blocked intentionally. Rather, the blocking of web.telegram.org was likely the collateral damage of the blocking of Telegram’s endpoints.</p><h1 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h1><p>Between 11th to 14th June 2019, Ethiopia experienced three internet blackouts, as suggested by <a href="https://ioda.caida.org/ioda/dashboard#view=inspect&amp;entity=country/ET&amp;lastView=overview&amp;from=1560166834&amp;until=1560958174">IODA</a> and <a href="https://transparencyreport.google.com/traffic/overview?fraction_traffic=start:1560038400000;end:1560816000000;product:1;region:ET&amp;lu=fraction_traffic">Google traffic</a> data.</p><p>Internet connectivity was restored thereafter, but <a href=https://explorer.ooni.io/country/ET>OONI data</a> shows that access to <a href=https://explorer.ooni.io/measurement/20190616T124137Z_AS24757_OkJV7OTNFUKSTKl7LeAzPdDPPd1gzhrz7E47A3svdGd5szbqOr>WhatsApp</a> and <a href=https://explorer.ooni.io/measurement/20190616T140326Z_AS24757_U2Z3q8xCv4wPIRXGtypey43UvKJPAXKDzEcW6Z5BoK52O862Fr>Telegram</a> was blocked between 15th to 18th June 2019.</p><p>Both WhatsApp’s registration service (v.whatsapp.net) and web interface (web.whatsapp.com) were blocked by means of SNI filtering, but the blocks were <a href=https://explorer.ooni.io/measurement/20190617T101028Z_AS24757_jFV9RYgWx65yZcbvkZqfOpE7a7DbdCBqFu0GfFJnomWBnHlrvw>lifted</a> by 10:10 UTC on 17th June 2019. Many Telegram endpoints were blocked between 15th to 18th June 2019, strongly suggesting that Telegram’s mobile app was blocked (though connections to some Telegram endpoints were successful). The IP blocking of Telegram’s mobile app appears to have resulted in the (likely unintentional) blocking of web.telegram.org as well.</p><p>These censorship events possibly occurred in an <a href=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-48653392>attempt to prevent high school students in Ethiopia from cheating during the national exams</a>, similarly to <a href=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ethopia-internet/ethiopia-cuts-off-internet-after-high-school-exam-leaks-idUSKBN18S535>previous years</a>.
