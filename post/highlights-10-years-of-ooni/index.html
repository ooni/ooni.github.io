censorship was being implemented on certain networks. Their main
motivation was to understand the blocking of Tor, but they were also
curious to know more broadly how censorship was affecting other services
as well.</p><p>While carrying out these investigations, they developed a set of scripts
that they would ask tech-savvy people in regions affected by censorship
to run. <a href=https://ooni.org/>OONI</a> was born out of the desire and need
to further systematize this collection of one-off network measurements
so that anyone, without coordination from us, could run them
independently and the results would be published for the world to see.</p><p>With this in mind, we worked on the following over the last decade:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Network measurement experiments designed to measure various forms
of internet censorship.</strong> All such
<a href=https://ooni.org/nettest/>experiments</a> have been based on
<a href=https://github.com/ooni/spec/tree/master/nettests>open methodologies</a>,
enabling the independent third-party verification (and
improvement) of our methods.</p></li><li><p><strong>Free and open source tools for measuring internet censorship.</strong>
Anyone can install <a href=https://ooni.org/install>OONI Probe</a> (on
both mobile and desktop platforms) to measure internet censorship
on their network. To enable use, we tried to make OONI Probe as
easy to use as possible, we included features based on community
requests, and we worked with the <a href=https://www.localizationlab.org/>Localization Lab</a> community on its
<a href=https://explore.transifex.com/otf/ooniprobe/>localization</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Real-time open data on internet censorship.</strong> We publish OONI
Probe measurements from around the world in <em>real-time</em>. Since
2012, we have published <a href=https://explorer.ooni.org/>more than 1 billion measurements</a> collected from 28
thousand networks in 241 countries and territories. To enable the
independent third-party analysis and verification of <a href=https://ooni.org/data/>OONI data</a>, we provide raw OONI data in JSON
format through the <a href=https://api.ooni.io/>OONI API</a>, and the
whole OONI dataset can be fetched from the <a href=https://ooni.org/post/mining-ooni-data>Amazon S3 bucket</a>. We also
published <a href=https://ooni.org/notebooks/tutorial-russia-data-analysis-case-study.html>documentation</a>
explaining how to analyze OONI data.</p></li><li><p><strong>Web platforms for investigating internet censorship through OONI
data.</strong> To enable researchers, journalists, and human rights
defenders to investigate internet censorship, we created <a href=https://explorer.ooni.org/>OONI Explorer</a>: a web platform that
enables you to search through OONI measurements. We also created
the <a href=https://explorer.ooni.org/chart/mat>Measurement Aggregation Toolkit (MAT)</a>, which enables you to
create your own charts based on aggregate views of real-time OONI data.</p></li><li><p><strong>Research on internet censorship based on OONI data.</strong> Over the
past decade, we published <a href=https://ooni.org/reports/>75 reports</a> documenting internet
censorship around the world. These reports highlight key
censorship events identified through OONI data. We also published
several research papers on internet censorship.</p></li><li><p><strong>Community engagement.</strong> All of the above requires that people run
<a href=https://ooni.org/install/>OONI Probe</a>, contributing network
measurements. As a result, global community engagement has been
core to our strategy. To this end, we established
<a href=https://ooni.org/partners>partnerships</a> with 41 digital rights
organizations, became a member of the global <a href=https://www.accessnow.org/keepiton/>#KeepItOn campaign</a> (fighting internet
shutdowns), facilitated numerous OONI workshops, and created
resources to support OONI community engagement efforts worldwide.</p></li></ul><p>In the following sections, we share key OONI highlights from the past
decade, as well as some of our plans for the future.</p><h1 id=highlights>Highlights</h1><h2 id=free-software-tools-for-measuring-internet-censorship>Free software tools for measuring internet censorship</h2><h3 id=network-measurement-tests>Network measurement tests</h3><p>Over the past decade, we have created numerous <a href=https://github.com/ooni/spec/tree/master/nettests>network measurement tests</a> designed to
measure various forms of internet censorship.</p><p>These include <a href=https://ooni.org/nettest/>tests</a> designed to measure:</p><ul><li><p>Blocking of <a href=https://ooni.org/nettest/web-connectivity/>websites</a>;</p></li><li><p>Blocking of instant messaging apps (<a href=https://ooni.org/nettest/whatsapp/>WhatsApp</a>, <a href=https://ooni.org/nettest/facebook-messenger/>Facebook Messenger</a>,

on networks worldwide. We also integrated the
<a href=https://ooni.org/nettest/ndt/>NDT</a> and
<a href=https://ooni.org/nettest/dash/>DASH</a> performance tests, developed
by, and in collaboration with, the <a href=https://nexa.polito.it/>Nexa Center for Internet and Society</a> and <a href=https://www.measurementlab.net/>Measurement Lab (M-Lab)</a>. To encourage community
members to contribute their own experiments to OONI Probe, we published
a
<a href=https://github.com/ooni/probe-cli/tree/master/internal/tutorial>tutorial</a>
explaining how to write OONI Probe tests.</p><p>More recently, we have been researching <a href=https://github.com/bassosimone/websteps-illustrated/>new methods</a> to
improve how we measure website blocking. Our new methods enumerate all
forms of website blocking, include support for HTTP/3 and a follow-up
<a href=https://github.com/ooni/spec/blob/master/nettests/ts-024-sni-blocking.md>SNI filtering test</a>,
enabling the collection of richer data. We aim to incrementally ship
these new methods as part of our <a href=https://ooni.org/nettest/web-connectivity/>Web Connectivity experiment</a> over the next
year.</p><h3 id=ooni-probe>OONI Probe</h3><p>You can measure various forms of internet censorship with <a href=https://ooni.org/install>OONI Probe</a>, currently available for

macOS, with <a href=https://github.com/ooni/probe-legacy/releases/tag/v1.0.0>OONI Probe 1.0.0</a> being
released in February 2014. Initially, OONI Probe was mainly run by
technologists, since it required familiarity with the command line. To
enable researchers and human rights defenders to run OONI Probe, we
<a href=https://ooni.org/post/web-ui-post/>released OONI Probe 2.0.0 with a web-based user interface</a>.</p><div><a href=/post/highlights-10-years-of-ooni/images/03.png><img src=/post/highlights-10-years-of-ooni/images/03_hu6592c142e4e2c3782033dc1440884525_58927_1000x800_fit_box_3.png></a></div><p>During the same year (2016), we also established the <a href=https://ooni.org/get-involved/partnership-program/>OONI Partnership Program</a> to
collaborate with digital rights organizations on measuring internet
censorship around the world. To enable our partners to contribute stable
measurements, we released an <a href=https://ooni.org/post/lepidopter/><em>OONI Probe distribution for Raspberry
Pis</em></a> (“Lepidopter”).</p><div><a href=/post/highlights-10-years-of-ooni/images/04.png><img src=/post/highlights-10-years-of-ooni/images/04_huc0f51ed867c70f281310405f052c29d1_58554_1000x800_fit_box_3.png></a></div><p><strong>Image:</strong> OONI Probe for Raspberry Pi (credit: <a href=https://sinarproject.org/><em>Sinar
Project</em></a>).</p><p>While “Lepidopter” played an important role in boosting OONI measurement
coverage (with daily measurements collected automatically), shipping
(and troubleshooting) Raspberry Pis was not sustainable for our small
team in the long-run. We therefore aimed to instead prioritize our
efforts on building OONI Probe apps that anyone can easily install and
run, without requiring any technical knowledge.</p><p>Notably, we <a href=https://ooni.org/post/ooni-mobile-app/>launched the OONI Probe mobile app</a> (for Android, F-Droid and
iOS) in February 2017, bringing censorship measurement to hundreds of
thousands of people worldwide. <strong>This launch was a <em>major milestone</em>
because, for the first time, anyone could independently measure internet
censorship – without requiring any technical knowledge or expertise. For
the first time, anyone with a smartphone (most internet users worldwide)
could easily measure and contribute data on internet censorship with the
tap of a button!</strong> And based on community feedback, we <a href=https://ooni.org/post/revamped-ooni-probe-mobile-app/>launched a revamped version of OONI Probe Mobile</a> (with a
major UI overhaul) two years later (2019).</p><div><a href=/post/highlights-10-years-of-ooni/images/05.png><img src=/post/highlights-10-years-of-ooni/images/05_huc9b6507904b3fc41c893909c441cd250_641012_1000x800_fit_box_3.png srcset="/post/highlights-10-years-of-ooni/images/05_huc9b6507904b3fc41c893909c441cd250_641012_2000x1600_fit_box_3.png 2x"></a></div><p><strong>Image:</strong> Comparison of OONI Probe Mobile 1.0 (old) with OONI Probe

significant role in boosting OONI measurement coverage worldwide,
desktop users still had to use the terminal to run OONI Probe. To enable
people to run OONI Probe on as many platforms as possible, we <a href=https://ooni.org/post/2020-ooni-probe-desktop-app/>launched an OONI Probe desktop app for Windows and macOS</a> in April
2020.</p><div><a href=/post/highlights-10-years-of-ooni/images/07.png><img src=/post/highlights-10-years-of-ooni/images/07_hu529f0889e7230c52b79b0caf736948df_167634_1000x800_fit_box_3.png></a></div><p>With the <a href=https://ooni.org/install/>OONI Probe mobile and desktop apps</a>, anyone can measure internet
censorship on multiple platforms, with the click of a button! To enable
technologists to install OONI Probe on servers and contribute more
regular measurements, we also released a <a href=https://ooni.org/install/cli>new OONI Probe Command Line Interface (CLI)</a> for Linux and macOS.</p><div><a href=/post/highlights-10-years-of-ooni/images/08.png><img src=/post/highlights-10-years-of-ooni/images/08_hu9b393a4a5e9c866f1fc3b39856f41088_249886_1000x800_fit_box_3.png></a></div><p>In response to community requests, we built a browser-based version of
OONI Probe (“OONI Probe Web”) which we plan to launch in 2023.</p><div><a href=/post/highlights-10-years-of-ooni/images/09.png><img src=/post/highlights-10-years-of-ooni/images/09_hu3feac78e7d29c90a37e57f5e7f913d7e_122122_1000x800_fit_box_3.png></a></div><p>Overall, to improve the monitoring of website censorship around the
world, we created a “<a href=https://ooni.org/post/ooni-smart-url-list-system/>smart URL list system</a>” which
ensures that more relevant and <a href=https://github.com/citizenlab/test-lists/pulls>recently merged</a> URLs are
prioritized for testing. This has supported rapid response efforts
worldwide, ensuring that newly blocked URLs are immediately tested.</p><h3 id=ooni-run>OONI Run</h3><div><a href=/post/highlights-10-years-of-ooni/images/10.png><img src=/post/highlights-10-years-of-ooni/images/10_huec876dd305c5985fed5812a28db56802_66339_1000x800_fit_box_3.png></a></div><p>Running <a href=https://ooni.org/install/>OONI Probe</a> on your network is not
enough. Often, we hear of censorship in <em>different</em> countries (where
we’re not physically based), and there’s the need to coordinate with
OONI Probe users in <em>other</em> countries for censorship testing.</p><p>To support community efforts aimed at coordinating censorship testing,
we <a href=https://ooni.org/post/ooni-run/>launched OONI Run</a> in September
2017. <a href=https://run.ooni.io/>OONI Run</a> is a platform that you can use
to generate mobile deep links and widget code to coordinate OONI Probe
testing. Initially, OONI Run supported multiple OONI Probe tests, but
based on <a href=https://ooni.org/post/2020-06-09-ooni-run-usability-study-findings/>community feedback</a>,
we limited the platform to website testing and made other improvements.</p><p>Over the past 5 years, community members have used OONI Run to
coordinate censorship testing with their local communities in countries
like <a href=https://vesinfiltro.com/>Venezuela</a> and
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIn-r6JxdEM">Ukraine</a>. OONI Run has
also been used to coordinate the testing of specific websites that risk
being blocked during political events, such as elections. <a href=https://sinarproject.org/>Sinar Project</a>, for example, recently
<a href=https://sinarproject.org/digital-rights/measuring-and-detecting-network-interference/ge15>coordinated an OONI Probe testing campaign (using OONI Run links and widget code) in Malaysia</a>
during the country’s 2022 elections.</p><h2 id=real-time-open-data-on-internet-censorship>Real-time open data on internet censorship</h2><p>As of 1st October 2020, OONI Probe measurements from around the world
are published in real-time! This means that as soon as you run <a href=https://ooni.org/install/>OONI Probe</a> (anywhere in the world), your test
results are immediately published as <a href=https://ooni.org/data/>open data</a> within seconds.</p><p><strong>This is an important milestone because it means that the public can
track (and rapidly respond to) censorship events around the world <em>as
they emerge</em>.</strong> This is also the first time that any project publishes
open data on internet censorship in real-time.</p><p>Migrating our infrastructure to <a href=https://clickhouse.com/>ClickHouse</a>
enabled the real-time publication of OONI measurements, supporting human
rights defenders to rapidly monitor and respond to internet censorship
around the world.</p><h3 id=ooni-explorer>OONI Explorer</h3><p>To enable researchers, journalists, and human rights defenders to

(among many others). The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) also
published an
<a href=https://cpj.org/2019/09/qa-ooni-explorer-team-unlock-the-webs-untold-censo/>article</a>
which discusses why journalists should use OONI data.</p><h1 id=future-goals>Future goals</h1><p>Ultimately, our goal is to ensure that internet censorship is
well-documented and rapidly addressed so that human rights are
protected.</p><p>Over the past decade, community feedback has shaped the specific
activities that we have carried out towards this goal, as we aim to
ensure that the tools we build meet community needs. We thank all
community members who shared feedback with us over the years, and we
thank community members who recently shared more feedback through our
<a href=https://ooni.org/post/2022-survey-ooni-strategic-priorities/>survey</a>.</p><p>Based on long-term community feedback and strategic planning, our future
goals (for at least the next 2 years) include:</p><ul><li><p>Expanding OONI’s censorship detection capabilities;</p></li><li><p>Enabling the discovery of censorship findings through real-time OONI
data;</p></li><li><p>Empowering global community participation in censorship measurement
research and advocacy.</p></li></ul><p>Below we list some of the main activities through which we aim to
achieve each of the above goals.</p><p><strong>Expanding OONI’s censorship detection capabilities</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Create an open methodology for measuring throttling.</strong> This will
be shipped as part of the <a href=https://ooni.org/install>OONI Probe apps</a>, enabling communities worldwide
to contribute data that can help with detecting cases of
throttling.</p></li><li><p><strong>Expand OONI’s censorship measurement methodologies.</strong> This
involves making improvements to <em>existing</em> <a href=https://github.com/ooni/spec/tree/master/nettests>OONI Probe tests</a> (to
improve the data quality of measurements), as well designing and
developing <em>new</em> tests.</p></li><li><p><strong>Expand OONI’s testing model to support richer testing input.</strong>
This will enable all <a href=https://ooni.org/install>OONI Probe</a>
users to more easily run <em>novel experiments</em>, automatically
process these measurements and present findings on <a href=https://explorer.ooni.org/>OONI Explorer</a> as open data.</p></li><li><p><strong>Automate censorship detection and characterization based on OONI
measurements.</strong> We aim to expand our ability to automatically
confirm blocks based on fingerprints, and to develop new metrics
for the automatic characterization of more forms of internet
censorship.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Enabling the discovery of censorship findings through real-time OONI
data</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Create a Social Media Censorship Alert System.</strong> We aim to develop
a system that the public can refer to in order to learn when and
where access to social media platforms is being restricted around
the world based on empirical OONI data.</p></li><li><p><strong>Create a Censorship Incident Reporting Platform.</strong> This will
regularly provide short reports with summary information on
emergent censorship events based on OONI data and charts, enabling
journalists and human rights defenders to more easily learn about
and respond to censorship events.</p></li><li><p><strong>Present thematic censorship findings on OONI Explorer.</strong> We aim to
create new pages on <a href=https://explorer.ooni.org/><em>OONI Explorer</em></a>
which present thematic censorship findings from around the world
(such as findings on the blocking of news media and human rights
websites based on OONI data). This may involve presenting
measurements in a resource-centric way (for example, by grouping
all measurements pertaining to Facebook resources) to enable
community members to more easily discover if access to a specific
resource is blocked.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Empowering global community participation in censorship measurement
research and advocacy</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Expand OONI community resources.</strong> To support OONI community
engagement efforts around the world, we aim to improve, localize,
and expand upon OONI resources (such as training materials,
screencasts, user guides, videos, and outreach materials).</p></li><li><p><strong>Facilitate more OONI workshops.</strong> We aim to continue to facilitate
OONI workshops and training for human rights defenders,
researchers, and journalists around the world. We also aim to
organize and host more OONI Partner events, and other community
meetings and events.</p></li><li><p><strong>Publish more research reports on internet censorship around the world.</strong> We will continue to collaborate with our
<a href=https://ooni.org/partners>partners</a> on investigating and
<a href=https://ooni.org/reports/>reporting</a> on internet censorship
events around the world.</p></li></ul><h1 id=acknowledgements>Acknowledgements</h1><p>We thank the <a href=https://www.torproject.org/>Tor Project</a> for supporting
