<a href=https://ooni.org/>OONI</a>, a censorship measurement project
under the Tor Project, responded by publishing a
<a href=https://ooni.org/post/egypt-censors/>report</a> on the
blocking of (at least) 10 media websites, including <a href="https://explorer.ooni.org/measurement/20170527T022637Z_AS24863_a2cVejuvTKddBoVLe3DyDGnPfEnaoUAmP51zo3jTJNEdF6iJJT?input=https:%2F%2Fmadamasr.com">Mada Masr</a>

In an attempt to identify the remaining blocked sites, Egypt’s
<a href=https://afteegypt.org/>Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (AFTE)</a> ran <a href=https://ooni.org/install/>OONI Probe</a> across multiple networks
in Egypt. They subsequently published <a href="https://afteegypt.org/right_to_know-2/publicationsright_to_know-right_to_know-2/2017/06/04/13069-afteegypt.html?lang=en">two research reports</a>,
uncovering the blocking of hundreds of URLs (which expand beyond media
sites).</p><p>OONI and AFTE joined forces. Today, we publish a joint research report
on internet censorship in Egypt, based on our analysis of <a href=https://api.ooni.io/files/by_country/EG>OONI network measurements</a> collected
between January 2017 to May 2018.</p><p>Our research report is available
<strong><a href=/documents/Egypt-Internet-Censorship-AFTE-OONI-2018-07.pdf>here</a></strong>.</p><p>Below we share some of the key findings.</p><h1 id=pervasive-media-censorship>Pervasive media censorship</h1><p><a href=/post/egypt-internet-censorship/eg-anomalous-urls.csv>More than 1,000 URLs</a>
presented network anomalies throughout the testing period,
<a href=/post/egypt-internet-censorship/eg-blocked-sites.csv>178</a>
of which consistently presented a high ratio of HTTP failures, strongly
suggesting that they were blocked. Rather than serving block pages
(which would have provided a notification of the blocking), Egyptian
ISPs appear to primarily block sites through the use of Deep Packet
Inspection (DPI) technology that resets connections.</p><p>In some cases, instead of RST injection, ISPs drop packets, suggesting a
variance in filtering rules. In other cases, ISPs <a href=/post/egypt-internet-censorship/eg-ssl-interference-cloudflare.csv>interfere with the SSL encrypted traffic</a>
between Cloudflare’s Point-of-Presence in Cairo and the backend servers

hosted outside of Egypt. Latency measurements over the last year and a
half also suggest that Egyptian ISPs may have changed their filtering
equipment and/or techniques, since the latency-based detection of
middleboxes has become more challenging.</p><p>The chart below illustrates the types of sites that presented the
highest amount of network anomalies and are therefore considered to more
likely have been blocked.</p><div><img src=/post/egypt-internet-censorship/EgyptWebsitesBlockedChart.png srcset="/post/egypt-internet-censorship/EgyptWebsitesBlockedChart@2x.png 2x"></div><p><a href=/post/egypt-internet-censorship/eg-blocked-news.csv>More than 100 URLs</a>

Various Turkish and Iranian news websites were blocked (such as

suggesting that politics and security concerns may have influenced
censorship decisions. In an attempt to circumvent censorship, some
Egyptian media organizations set up <a href="https://afteegypt.org/right_to_know-2/publicationsright_to_know-right_to_know-2/2017/06/04/13069-afteegypt.html?lang=en">alternative domains</a>,

as well.</p><p>To examine the <em>impact</em> of these censorship events, AFTE interviewed
staff members working with some of the Egyptian media organizations
whose websites got blocked. They reported that the censorship has had a
severe impact on their work. In addition to not being able to publish
and losing part of their audience, the censorship has also had a
financial impact on their operations and deterred sources from reaching
out to their journalists. A number of Egyptian media organizations have
<a href=https://www.facebook.com/korabia/posts/768019583402612>suspended</a>
their work entirely, as a result of persisting internet censorship.</p><p>Many other websites, beyond media, appear to have been blocked as well.

raising the question of whether censorship decisions were politically
motivated.</p><h1 id=defense-in-depth-tactics-for-network-filtering>“Defense in depth” tactics for network filtering</h1><p>Security experts are probably familiar with the “<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_in_depth_(computing)>defense in depth</a>”
concept in which multiple layers of security controls (defense) are
placed throughout an IT system, providing redundancy in the event that a
security control fails. In Egypt, ISPs seem to apply “defense in depth”
tactics for <em>network filtering</em> by creating multiple layers of
censorship that make circumvention harder.</p><p>This is particularly evident when looking at the
<a href="https://explorer.ooni.org/measurement/20180601T082146Z_AS24835_zCgwzOSmbXDftZn5OftmYZCDf5tw6SrDclPlgiMJ7YREynuOu0?input=http:%2F%2Fwww.fj-p.com">blocking</a>
of Egypt’s Freedom and Justice Party (FJP) site. Our testing shows that
different versions of this site (<a href=http://www.fj-p.com>http://www.fj-p.com</a> and
<a href=http://fj-p.com>http://fj-p.com</a>) were blocked by <em>two</em> different middleboxes. In doing
so, Egyptian ISPs added extra layers of censorship, ensuring that
circumvention requires extra effort.</p><p>Not only were numerous circumvention tool sites (including
<a href="https://explorer.ooni.org/measurement/20180520T131028Z_AS8452_5VILUU3mOu51zwtD1E6n2E6Q0KGyq5cuWApNkAaZSCMoHZXxJc?input=http:%2F%2Fwww.torproject.org">torproject.org</a>

suggest that the Tor network is inaccessible, since the tests weren’t
able to bootstrap connections to the Tor network within 300 seconds. In
recent months, more than 460 measurements show connections to the Tor

indicate that access to the Tor network is blocked. The Tor bootstrap
process is likely being disrupted via the <a href=https://ooni.org/post/egypt-network-interference/#attempts-to-block-tor>blocking of requests to directory authorities</a>.</p><p>“Defense in depth” tactics also seem to be applied in relation to the
blocking of <a href=https://bridges.torproject.org/>Tor bridges</a>, which
enable Tor censorship circumvention. Vodafone appears to be <a href="https://explorer.ooni.org/measurement/20170606T163348Z_AS36935_FbKgm7SUyJTvlqJuxe5nSHNk98fMPcqjExFsOIEJcdBs1ixqoi?input=obfs4%20176.56.237.144:80">blocking obfs4</a>

through the use of <a href=https://github.com/TheTorProject/ooni-probe>free and open source software</a>, <a href=https://ooni.org/docs/>open methodologies</a> and <a href=https://api.ooni.io/>open data</a>, it can be reproduced and expanded upon.</p><p>Anyone can <a href=https://ooni.org/install/>run OONI Probe</a> on
Android, iOS, macOS, Linux, and on Raspberry Pis. Tens of thousands of
OONI Probe users from <a href=https://api.ooni.io/stats>more than 200 countries</a> do so every month. Thanks to
their testing, millions of network measurements have been
<a href=https://explorer.ooni.org/world/>published</a>, shedding
light on information controls worldwide.</p><p>But censorship findings are only as interesting as the types of sites
and services that are tested. We therefore encourage you to <a href=https://ooni.org/get-involved/contribute-test-lists/>contribute to the review and creation of test lists</a>,
to help advance future research in Egypt and beyond.</p><p><em>To learn more about this study, read the full report <a href=/documents/Egypt-Internet-Censorship-AFTE-OONI-2018-07.pdf>here</a>.</em></p></main></div><footer class=p-4><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-12 col-md-4"><div class=pb-2><img src=/images/logos/ooni-horizontal.svg height=32px alt="OONI Logo"></div><div class=pb-4>Global community measuring internet censorship around the world.</div><div><div>© 2022 Open Observatory of Network Interference (OONI)</div><div><a href=https://github.com/ooni/license>Content available under a Creative Commons license.</a></div></div></div><div class="col-12 col-md-8"><div class=row><div class="mt-3 col-sm"><div class=footer-section-title>About</div><div class=pt-1><a href=/about/>OONI</a></div><div class=pt-1><a href=/about/data-policy/>Data Policy</a></div><div class=pt-1><a href=https://github.com/ooni/license/tree/master/data>Data License</a></div><div class=pt-1><a href=/about/#contact>Contact</a></div></div><div class="mt-3 col-sm"><div class=footer-section-title>OONI Probe</div><div class=pt-1><a href=https://ooni.org/install/>Install</a></div><div class=pt-1><a href=https://ooni.org/nettest/>Tests</a></div><div class=pt-1><a href=https://github.com/ooni>Source code</a></div><div class=pt-1><a href=https://api.ooni.io/>API</a></div></div><div class="mt-3 col-sm"><div class=footer-section-title>Updates</div><div class=pt-1><a href=/post/>Blog</a></div><div class=pt-1><a href=https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/ooni-talk>Mailing list</a></div><div class=pt-1><a href=https://slack.ooni.org/>Slack</a></div><ul class="pt-1 footer-links-social"><li><a class=twitter href=https://twitter.com/OpenObservatory>Twitter (@OpenObservatory)</a></li><li><a class=youtube href=https://www.youtube.com/c/OONIorg>Youtube (OONIorg)</a></li><li><a class=facebook href=https://facebook.com/ooni.org>Facebook (ooni.org)</a></li><li><a class=instagram href=https://www.instagram.com/openobservatory/>Instagram (@OpenObservatory)</a></li><li><a class=mastodon rel=me href=https://mastodon.social/@ooni>Mastodon (@ooni@mastodon.social)</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div></footer></body></html>
