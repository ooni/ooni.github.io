As the timing of the blocks and the types of URLs blocked are (mostly) consistent across (tested) networks, ISPs in Tanzania likely implement blocks in a coordinated manner (possibly through the use of Deep Packet Inspection technology).</p><h2 id=introduction>Introduction</h2><p>Last September, we had the opportunity to attend the <a href=https://internetfreedom.africa/>Forum on Internet Freedom in Africa (FIFAfrica) 2023</a> in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. During the conference, we met participants from Tanzania, who informed us that they had started to experience increased levels of internet censorship in the country in recent months.</p><p>As our work centers around the study of internet censorship through the analysis of <a href=https://ooni.org/data/>crowdsourced network measurements</a> collected globally, we were curious to see if we could detect signs of increased levels of internet censorship in Tanzania over the past year — particularly since we hadn’t previously observed many blocks in Tanzania in recent years (except for a few cases, such as the <a href=https://ooni.org/post/2020-tanzania-blocks-social-media-tor-election-day/>blocking of social media during Tanzania’s 2020 general elections</a>).</p><p>As part of this study, we analyzed <a href="https://explorer.ooni.org/chart/mat?test_name=web_connectivity&axis_x=measurement_start_day&since=2023-12-01&until=2024-01-31&time_grain=day&probe_cc=TZ">OONI network measurement data</a> collected from Tanzania between 1st January 2023 to 31st January 2024. Our goal was to examine whether we could detect signs of internet censorship in Tanzania during this period. As we were mostly interested in cases of internet censorship that would be of public interest and have an impact on human rights, we excluded certain cases (such as the <a href="https://explorer.ooni.org/search?since=2023-01-01&until=2024-01-31&only=anomalies&failure=false&probe_cc=TZ&category_code=GMB">blocking of gambling</a> and <a href="https://explorer.ooni.org/search?since=2023-01-01&until=2024-01-31&only=anomalies&failure=false&probe_cc=TZ&category_code=PORN">adult websites</a>) from the findings presented in this study.</p><p>The main questions that informed our analysis of <a href="https://explorer.ooni.org/chart/mat?test_name=web_connectivity&axis_x=measurement_start_day&since=2023-12-01&until=2024-01-31&time_grain=day&probe_cc=TZ">OONI data</a> include:</p><ul><li>Which websites presented signs of blocking in Tanzania between 1st January 2023 to 31st January 2024?</li><li>On which networks do we observe these blocks?

We excluded measurements collected from the testing of <a href="https://explorer.ooni.org/chart/mat?probe_cc=TZ&since=2023-01-01&until=2024-01-31&time_grain=day&axis_x=measurement_start_day&test_name=signal">Signal</a> because they were impacted by <a href=https://github.com/ooni/probe/issues/2344>data quality issues</a> over the past year.</p><p>The methods and findings of our analysis are shared in the following sections of this report.</p><h2 id=methods>Methods</h2><p>Since 2012, the <a href=https://ooni.org/>Open Observatory of Network Interference (OONI)</a> has developed free and open source software (called <a href=https://ooni.org/install/>OONI Probe</a>) which is designed to <a href=https://ooni.org/nettest/>measure various forms of internet censorship</a>, including the blocking of websites and apps. Every month, OONI Probe is regularly run by volunteers in <a href=https://explorer.ooni.org/>around 160 countries</a> (including <a href=https://explorer.ooni.org/country/TZ>Tanzania</a>), and network measurements collected by OONI Probe users are automatically published as <a href=https://ooni.org/data>open data in real-time</a>.</p><p><a href=https://ooni.org/install/>OONI Probe</a> includes the <a href=https://ooni.org/nettest/web-connectivity/>Web Connectivity experiment</a> which is designed to measure the blocking of many different <a href=https://ooni.org/support/faq#which-websites-will-i-test-for-censorship-with-ooni-probe>websites</a> (included in the public, community-curated <a href=https://github.com/citizenlab/test-lists/tree/master/lists>Citizen Lab test lists</a>). Specifically, OONI’s <a href=https://ooni.org/nettest/web-connectivity/>Web Connectivity test</a> is designed to measure the accessibility of <a href=https://github.com/citizenlab/test-lists/tree/master/lists>URLs</a> by performing the following steps:</p><ul><li>Resolver identification</li><li>DNS lookup</li><li>TCP connect to the resolved IP addresses</li><li>TLS handshake to the resolved IP addresses</li><li>HTTP(s) GET request following redirects</li></ul><p>The above steps are automatically performed from both the local network of the user, and from a control vantage point. If the results from both networks are the same, the tested URL is annotated as accessible. If the results differ, the tested URL is annotated as <a href=https://ooni.org/support/faq#what-do-you-mean-by-anomalies>anomalous</a>, and the type of anomaly is further characterized depending on the reason that caused the failure (for example, if the TCP connection fails, the measurement is annotated as a TCP/IP anomaly).</p><p><a href=https://ooni.org/support/faq#what-do-you-mean-by-anomalies>Anomalous measurements</a> may be indicative of blocking, but <a href=https://ooni.org/support/faq#what-are-false-positives>false positives</a> can occur. We therefore consider that the likelihood of blocking is greater if the overall volume of anomalous measurements is high in comparison to the overall measurement count (compared on an ASN level within the same date range for each OONI Probe experiment type).</p><p>Each <a href=https://ooni.org/nettest/web-connectivity/>Web Connectivity</a> measurement provides further network information (such as information pertaining to TLS handshakes) that helps with evaluating whether an anomalous measurement presents signs of blocking. We therefore disaggregate based on the reasons that caused the anomaly (e.g. connection reset during the TLS handshake) and if they are consistent, they provide a stronger signal of potential blocking.</p><p>Based on OONI’s heuristics, we are able to automatically confirm the blocking of websites based on <a href=https://github.com/ooni/blocking-fingerprints>fingerprints</a> if a <a href=https://ooni.org/support/glossary#block-page>block page</a> is served, or if DNS resolution returns an IP known to be associated with censorship.

Most of the anomalous measurements <a href="https://explorer.ooni.org/search?probe_cc=TZ&test_name=web_connectivity&since=2023-01-01&until=2024-01-31&failure=false&only=anomalies">presented</a> “http-failures”, signaling that the anomalies were triggered by some failure during the HTTP experiment. We further analyzed these failures to detect the specific errors (such as “connection_reset_error” or “generic_timeout_error”) that would enable us to characterize potential blocking, and we aggregated the errors to examine whether and to what extent they were consistent across (relevant) measurements on each tested ASN.</p><p>This involved analyzing the network information from TLS handshake data in these measurements to evaluate whether the errors were a result of TLS based interference. For example, a measurement may show that DNS resolution returned consistent IPs, that it was possible to establish a connection to resolved IPs, but that the TLS handshake session timed out after the first ClientHello message (which is unencrypted), resulting in a “generic_timeout_error”. While we would consider that such a measurement shows signs of potential TLS based interference, we would not draw conclusions from a single measurement alone.</p><p>We therefore aggregated the errors to determine whether a large percentage of anomalous measurements for a tested URL presented the same error (e.g. “tls_timeout_error”) in comparison to the overall measurement volume on a specific network, within a specified date range. The higher the ratio of consistent errors (from anomalous measurements) in comparison to the overall measurement count, the stronger the signal (and the greater our confidence) that access to the tested domain is (a) blocked, and (b) blocked in a specific way (e.g TLS interference).</p><p>As part of our analysis, we excluded cases which provided weak signals. Those included cases with small/limited measurement coverage (in comparison to the overall measurement coverage on a tested ASN during the analysis period), a low percentage of anomalies (in comparison to the overall measurement volume for a tested service on a network), a relatively large proportion of inconsistent failure types and errors, as well as cases which were determined to be false positives based on known bugs or other issues (such as global failure rates as a result of tested services being hosted on unreliable servers, or measurements collected from unreliable networks). Once we started to develop a strong signal on how blocks were implemented in Tanzania (in this study, we found that “tls.timeout_errors” were present in the vast majority of anomalous measurements), we started to consider measurements with different errors as weaker signals (considering them likely false positives). As a result, the findings of this study are limited to measurements that we considered to present stronger signals based on our analysis methods.</p><h3 id=acknowledgement-of-limitations>Acknowledgement of limitations</h3><p>The findings of this study present several limitations, including:</p><ul><li><strong>Date range of analysis.</strong> The findings are limited to <a href="https://explorer.ooni.org/chart/mat?test_name=web_connectivity&axis_x=measurement_start_day&since=2023-12-01&until=2024-01-31&time_grain=day&probe_cc=TZ">OONI measurements collected from Tanzania</a> between 1st January 2023 to 31st January 2024.

As a result, findings from <a href=https://ooni.org/nettest>other OONI Probe experiments</a> (particularly those that don’t measure the blocking of websites and apps) are excluded from this study.</li><li><strong>Tested websites.</strong> The testing is mostly limited to URLs included in two <a href=https://github.com/citizenlab/test-lists/tree/master/lists>Citizen Lab test lists</a>: the <a href=https://github.com/citizenlab/test-lists/blob/master/lists/global.csv>global list</a> (including internationally-relevant URLs) and the <a href=https://github.com/citizenlab/test-lists/blob/master/lists/tz.csv>Tanzanian list</a> (only including URLs relevant to Tanzania). As these lists are tested by <a href=https://ooni.org/install>OONI Probe</a> users and there are bandwidth constraints, they are generally limited to around 1,000 URLs. As a result, the lists may exclude other websites which might be blocked in Tanzania, and the findings are limited to the testing of the URLs included in these lists. Given that the lists are community-curated, we acknowledge the bias in terms of which URLs are added to the lists.</li><li><strong>Testing coverage of websites.</strong> Not all URLs included in <a href=https://github.com/citizenlab/test-lists/tree/master/lists>test lists</a> are measured equally across Tanzania over time. Whether OONI data is available for a particular website depends on whether, on which networks, and when an <a href=https://ooni.org/install>OONI Probe</a> user in Tanzania tested it. As a result, tested websites received different testing coverage throughout the analysis period, which impacts the findings.</li><li><strong>Tested ASNs.</strong> While OONI Probe tests are regularly performed on multiple ASNs in Tanzania, not all networks are tested equally. Rather, the availability of measurements depends on which networks <a href=https://ooni.org/install>OONI Probe</a> users were connected to when performing tests. As a result, the measurement coverage varies across ASNs throughout the analysis period, impacting the findings.</li><li><strong>Blocking signals.</strong> As part of our data analysis, we limited our findings to signals that we considered more reliable and indicative of government-commissioned censorship, while excluding cases viewed as presenting weak signals (as discussed previously in the “Methods” section).

This is consistent with the types of failures and means of blocking observed for other blocked websites in Tanzania (as discussed in previous sections of this report).</p><p>While the exact motivation for these blocks is quite unclear to us, it is worth mentioning that GlobalGiving previously hosted a <a href=https://www.globalgiving.org/projects/help-sustain-lgbt-voice-tanzania/>crowdfunding project in support of LGBT Voice Tanzania</a> (which promotes LGBTIQ human rights in Tanzania), which we also found to be <a href="https://explorer.ooni.org/chart/mat?test_name=web_connectivity&axis_x=measurement_start_day&since=2023-01-01&until=2024-01-31&time_grain=day&probe_cc=TZ&domain=lgbtvoicetz.org">blocked</a> in the country.

The results of our analysis show that most ISPs in Tanzania appear to implement blocks by means of <strong>TLS interference</strong>, specifically by timing out the session after the ClientHello message during the TLS handshake. This suggests the potential use of Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) technology. As the timing of the blocks and the types of URLs blocked are (mostly) consistent across networks, ISPs in Tanzania likely implement blocks in a coordinated manner (based on government orders).</p><p>Even though we found many different websites blocked in Tanzania over the past year, our findings suggest that these blocks are mostly targeted in nature. Many of the blocks identified in this study involve <strong>LGBTIQ websites</strong>, which correlates with the <a href=https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2018/11/bachelet-tanzania-has-duty-protect-not-further-endanger-lgbt-people>escalating discrimination and crackdown on LGBTIQ communities</a> in Tanzania in recent years. The blocking of a wide range of LGBTIQ websites – including <a href="https://explorer.ooni.org/chart/mat?probe_cc=TZ&since=2023-12-01&until=2024-01-31&time_grain=day&axis_x=measurement_start_day&test_name=web_connectivity&domain=www.grindr.com">LGBTIQ social networks</a>, sites that <a href="https://explorer.ooni.org/chart/mat?probe_cc=TZ&since=2023-12-01&until=2024-01-31&time_grain=day&axis_x=measurement_start_day&test_name=web_connectivity&domain=outrightinternational.org">defend LGBTIQ rights</a>, <a href="https://explorer.ooni.org/chart/mat?probe_cc=TZ&since=2023-12-01&until=2024-01-31&time_grain=day&axis_x=measurement_start_day&test_name=web_connectivity&domain=www.queerty.com">LGBTIQ news and culture</a>, and an <a href="https://explorer.ooni.org/chart/mat?probe_cc=TZ&since=2023-12-01&until=2024-01-31&time_grain=day&axis_x=measurement_start_day&test_name=web_connectivity&domain=www.thetrevorproject.org">LGBTIQ suicide prevention site</a> – suggests an intensification of government attempts to stifle LGBTIQ communities in Tanzania.</p><p>Most social media platforms were found accessible in Tanzania throughout the analysis period, while only <a href="https://explorer.ooni.org/chart/mat?probe_cc=TZ&since=2023-12-01&until=2024-01-31&time_grain=day&axis_x=measurement_start_day&test_name=web_connectivity&domain=www.clubhouse.com">Clubhouse</a> and <a href="https://explorer.ooni.org/chart/mat?probe_cc=TZ&since=2023-12-01&until=2024-01-31&time_grain=day&axis_x=measurement_start_day&test_name=web_connectivity&domain=www.4chan.org">4chan</a> were found blocked. This suggests that these blocks may have been targeted in an attempt to stifle specific thematic discussions by groups using those platforms. Quite similarly, many human rights websites (such as those of <a href="https://explorer.ooni.org/chart/mat?probe_cc=TZ&since=2023-01-01&until=2024-01-31&time_grain=day&axis_x=measurement_start_day&test_name=web_connectivity&domain=www.hrw.org">Human Rights Watch</a> and <a href="https://explorer.ooni.org/chart/mat?probe_cc=TZ&since=2023-01-01&until=2024-01-31&time_grain=day&axis_x=measurement_start_day&test_name=web_connectivity&domain=www.amnesty.org">Amnesty International</a>) were (mostly) accessible in Tanzania over the last year, while OONI data shows the <a href="https://explorer.ooni.org/chart/mat?probe_cc=TZ&since=2024-01-01&until=2024-04-02&time_grain=day&axis_x=measurement_start_day&test_name=web_connectivity&domain=www.change.org">blocking of</a> <a href="https://explorer.ooni.org/chart/mat?probe_cc=TZ&since=2024-01-01&until=2024-04-02&time_grain=day&axis_x=measurement_start_day&test_name=web_connectivity&domain=www.change.org">Change.org</a>, <a href="https://explorer.ooni.org/chart/mat?probe_cc=TZ&since=2024-01-01&until=2024-04-02&time_grain=day&axis_x=measurement_start_day&test_name=web_connectivity&domain=www.globalfundforwomen.org">Global Fund for Women</a>, <a href="https://explorer.ooni.org/chart/mat?probe_cc=TZ&since=2024-01-01&until=2024-04-02&time_grain=day&axis_x=measurement_start_day&test_name=web_connectivity&domain=www.globalgiving.org">GlobalGiving</a> and <a href="https://explorer.ooni.org/chart/mat?probe_cc=TZ&since=2024-01-01&until=2024-04-02&time_grain=day&axis_x=measurement_start_day&test_name=web_connectivity&domain=www.opensocietyfoundations.org">Open Society Foundations</a>. These blocks may have been motivated by an attempt to limit support towards causes that the government does not approve (further suggesting the targeted nature of the blocks).</p><p>Meanwhile, the Tanzania Communications Regulatory Authority (TCRA) recently started requiring users in Tanzania to <a href=https://www.thecitizen.co.tz/tanzania/news/national/tcra-wants-vpn-users-to-come-clean-reveal-their-ip-addresses-4400358>report their use of VPNs</a>. We found that most <a href="https://explorer.ooni.org/chart/mat?test_name=web_connectivity&axis_x=measurement_start_day&since=2023-01-01&until=2024-01-31&time_grain=day&probe_cc=TZ&axis_y=domain&category_code=ANON">tested VPN websites</a> are still accessible in Tanzania, and that only <a href="https://explorer.ooni.org/chart/mat?probe_cc=TZ&since=2023-01-01&until=2024-01-31&time_grain=day&axis_x=measurement_start_day&axis_y=domain&test_name=web_connectivity&domain=protonvpn.com%2Capi.protonvpn.ch">ProtonVPN was blocked</a> over the last year. This suggests that while users in Tanzania are now required to report their use of VPNs, the use of VPNs is not widely restricted (through blocks).</p><p>Yet, the new VPN reporting requirement raises the question of whether it will result in less VPN use in Tanzania and, by extension, less censorship circumvention. And if it results in less censorship circumvention, it raises the question of what impact the blocks (identified through this study) would have on LGBTIQ communities and other human rights movements in Tanzania. We encourage researchers to explore these questions through future studies.</p><h2 id=acknowledgements>Acknowledgements</h2><p>We thank <a href=https://ooni.org/install/>OONI Probe</a> users in Tanzania for contributing measurements, supporting this study.</p></main></div><footer class=bg-blue9 aria-labelledby=footer-heading><h2 id=footer-heading class=sr-only>Footer</h2><div class="mx-auto px-6 pb-8 pt-16 lg:px-8"><div class="xl:grid xl:grid-cols-3 xl:gap-8"><div class=space-y-8><img src=/images/logos/ooni-horizontal.svg class=h-7 alt="OONI Logo"><p class="text-sm leading-6 text-gray3">Global community measuring internet censorship around the
