However, most OONI measurements suggest that tested circumvention tools (<a href="https://explorer.ooni.org/chart/mat?probe_cc=AZ&amp;since=2022-01-01&amp;until=2023-02-24&amp;time_grain=day&amp;axis_x=measurement_start_day&amp;test_name=tor">Tor</a> and <a href="https://explorer.ooni.org/chart/mat?probe_cc=AZ&amp;since=2022-01-01&amp;until=2023-02-24&amp;time_grain=day&amp;axis_x=measurement_start_day&amp;test_name=psiphon">Psiphon</a>) appear to be reachable.</li><li><strong>Variance of censorship across networks.</strong> While most ISPs in Azerbaijan appear to adopt similar censorship techniques (as we continued to observe connection timeouts in most anomalous measurements across ASNs), different ISPs block access to different websites over time.</li></ul><h2 id=methods>Methods</h2><p>Since 2012, OONI has developed <a href=https://github.com/ooni/>free and open source software</a>, called <a href=https://ooni.org/install/>OONI Probe</a>, designed to <a href=https://ooni.org/nettest/>measure various forms of internet censorship</a>. OONI Probe is run by volunteers in around 160 countries every month, and their test results are automatically <a href=https://ooni.org/data/>published by OONI as open data in real-time</a>. More than <a href=https://explorer.ooni.org/>a billion network measurements</a> have been collected and published from 25 thousand networks in 241 countries and territories over the last decade.</p><p>To examine internet censorship in Azerbaijan, we analyzed <a href="https://explorer.ooni.org/chart/mat?probe_cc=AZ&amp;since=2022-01-01&amp;until=2023-02-24&amp;time_grain=day&amp;axis_x=measurement_start_day&amp;test_name=web_connectivity">OONI measurements collected from Azerbaijan</a> between January 2022 to February 2023. The goal of our analysis was to identify which websites and apps presented signs of blocking (“anomalies”) in Azerbaijan during the analysis period, particularly in comparison to blocks previously identified as part of our <a href=https://ooni.org/post/2021-azerbaijan/>past research</a>.  </p><p>Specifically, we analyzed measurements collected from <a href=https://ooni.org/nettest/web-connectivity/>OONI’s Web Connectivity test</a>, which is designed to measure the blocking of websites (these websites are publicly hosted on the <a href=https://github.com/citizenlab/test-lists/tree/master/lists>Citizen Lab test list Github repository</a>). This test measures the accessibility of websites by attempting to perform a <a href=https://ooni.org/support/glossary/#dns-lookup>DNS lookup</a>, TCP/IP connection, and <a href=https://ooni.org/support/glossary/#http-request>HTTP GET request</a> from two vantage points: (1) the local vantage point of the user and (2) a control network (non-censored network). The results from both networks are automatically compared and if they match, the tested URL is annotated as “accessible” (if the testing succeeds from the control vantage point). If the results differ, the tested URL is annotated as “<a href=https://ooni.org/support/faq/#what-do-you-mean-by-anomalies>anomalous</a>”, which may provide a signal of potential blocking.</p><p>Depending on why the anomaly emerges, the anomalous measurement is automatically annotated as a DNS, TCP/IP, HTTP diff, or HTTP failure anomaly. For example, if the DNS lookup resolves to an IP address which differs from that resolved from the control vantage point, the measurement is annotated as a “DNS anomaly”, which may be a sign of <a href=https://ooni.org/support/glossary/#dns-tampering>DNS tampering</a>.</p><p>However, <a href=https://ooni.org/support/faq/#what-are-false-positives>false positives</a> can occur, which is why we look at anomalous measurements in aggregate in order to determine if a tested URL consistently presents a large volume of anomalous measurements (in comparison to successful measurements) on a tested network. If a tested URL presents a large volume of anomalies, it may provide a stronger signal of potential blocking. If the types of anomalies are consistent (for example, always presenting DNS anomalies on a tested network), they offer an even stronger signal of potential censorship (since they suggest the use of a specific censorship technique, such as <a href=https://ooni.org/support/glossary/#dns-hijacking>DNS hijacking</a>). But beyond aggregating anomalous measurements, we also analyze the raw data pertaining to anomalous measurements in order to identify the specific errors that occurred as part of the testing, offering insight into how a tested URL is potentially blocked.</p><p>Based on our current heuristics, we automatically confirm the blocking of websites when a <a href=https://ooni.org/support/glossary/#block-page>block page</a> is served and we have added the fingerprint of that blockpage to our database. We also automatically confirm the blocking of websites based on DNS answers containing IP addresses that are known to be associated with implementing internet censorship. For other forms of censorship, we analyze OONI data in order to aggregate anomalous measurements and identify why and how those anomalies occur, offering insight into additional cases of potential blocking.</p><h3 id=acknowledgement-of-limitations>Acknowledgement of limitations</h3><p>The findings of this study present several limitations, including:</p><ul><li><strong>Date range of analysis.</strong> The findings are limited to <a href="https://explorer.ooni.org/chart/mat?probe_cc=AZ&amp;since=2022-01-01&amp;until=2023-02-24&amp;time_grain=day&amp;axis_x=measurement_start_day&amp;test_name=web_connectivity">OONI measurements collected from Azerbaijan</a> between January 2022 to February 2023. As a result, findings from measurements collected in different date ranges are excluded from this study.</li><li><strong>Type of measurements.</strong> As part of this study, we primarily focus on OONI <a href=https://ooni.org/nettest/web-connectivity/>Web Connectivity</a> measurements which pertain to the testing of websites for censorship. This focus was selected due to <a href=https://ooni.org/post/2021-azerbaijan/>known website censorship</a> in the country, while aggregate views of OONI measurements from <a href=https://ooni.org/nettest>other OONI Probe experiments</a> did not present an important volume of anomalies that would have warranted more dedicated analysis.</li><li><strong>Tested websites.</strong> OONI Probe website testing in Azerbaijan is primarily limited to URLs included in 2 <a href=https://github.com/citizenlab/test-lists/tree/master/lists>Citizen Lab test lists</a>: the <a href=https://github.com/citizenlab/test-lists/blob/master/lists/global.csv>global list</a> (including internationally-relevant URLs) and the <a href=https://github.com/citizenlab/test-lists/blob/master/lists/az.csv>Azerbaijan list</a> (only including URLs relevant to Azerbaijan). As these lists are tested by <a href=https://ooni.org/install>OONI Probe</a> users and there are bandwidth constraints, they are generally limited to around 1,000 URLs. As a result, the lists may exclude other websites which are blocked in Azerbaijan, and the findings are limited to the testing of the URLs included in these lists. Given that the lists are community-curated, we acknowledge the bias in terms of which URLs are added to the lists.</li><li><strong>Testing coverage of websites.</strong> Not all URLs included in <a href=https://github.com/citizenlab/test-lists/tree/master/lists>test lists</a> are measured equally across Azerbaijan over time. Whether OONI data is available for a particular website depends on whether, on which networks, and when an <a href=https://ooni.org/install>OONI Probe</a> user in Azerbaijan tested it. As a result, tested websites received different testing coverage throughout the analysis period, which impacts the findings.  </li><li><strong>Tested ASNs.</strong> The availability of OONI measurements depends on which networks <a href=https://ooni.org/install>OONI Probe</a> users were connected to when performing tests. As a result, the measurement coverage varies across ASNs throughout the analysis period, impacting the findings.</li><li><strong>Measurement volume.</strong> <a href=https://explorer.ooni.org/country/AZ>OONI measurement coverage from Azerbaijan</a> has been rather limited over the years (in comparison to other countries), limiting our findings and confidence in confirming censorship events. The availability of OONI data depends entirely on volunteers running <a href=https://ooni.org/install/>OONI Probe</a> locally in Azerbaijan, which can be challenging in light of the political environment, <a href=https://ooni.org/about/risks/>potential risks</a> involved with running OONI Probe, and the relatively limited digital rights community engagement opportunities in Azerbaijan. That said, we observe an <a href="https://explorer.ooni.org/chart/mat?probe_cc=AZ&amp;since=2022-01-01&amp;until=2023-02-24&amp;time_grain=day&amp;axis_x=measurement_start_day&amp;test_name=web_connectivity">important spike in the overall measurement volume</a> from 14th September 2022 onwards (which has subsequently remained relatively stable), increasing our ability to detect censorship events thereafter. This is visible through the following chart.</li></ul><p><img src=images/image7.png alt></p><p><strong>Chart:</strong> OONI Probe Web Connectivity testing in Azerbaijan between 1st January 2022 to 23rd February 2023 (source: <a href="https://explorer.ooni.org/chart/mat?probe_cc=AZ&amp;since=2022-01-01&amp;until=2023-02-24&amp;time_grain=day&amp;axis_x=measurement_start_day&amp;test_name=web_connectivity">OONI data</a>).</p><h2 id=background>Background</h2><p>In its latest <a href=https://freedomhouse.org/country/azerbaijan/freedom-net/2022>Freedom on the Net report</a> by Freedom House, Azerbaijan was ranked “not free” among 70 countries assessed for the report. Internet freedoms have been on an overall decline in the country for a number of years, however, the situation escalated during the 2020 war between Armenia and Azerbaijan. Since then, while blocking of social media platforms, and internet throttling have reduced, the state continues to implement various forms of digital surveillance combined with offline measures targeting civil society representatives on a regular basis.</p><p>News websites critical of the authorities remain blocked, while the <a href=https://www.az-netwatch.org/news/azerbaijans-media-registry-leaves-media-platforms-in-limbo/>Law on Media</a> enacted in February 2022 is yet another measure imposed by the state to restrict not only media freedom, and freedom of speech but also access to independent and opposition news.</p><p>Journalists across the country remain concerned about the new law.

Meanwhile, Azerbaijan <a href=https://www.turan.az/ext/news/2022/6/free/politics_news/ru/5722.htm>reportedly started blocking access to RIA Novosti</a> (Russian state-owned news media) in early June 2022 over the publication of slanderous materials against Azerbaijan. At the time, RIA Novosti’s website (`ria.ru`) was only included in other countries&rsquo; <a href=https://github.com/citizenlab/test-lists/tree/master/lists>test lists</a>; we therefore <a href=https://github.com/citizenlab/test-lists/pull/1000>added</a> it to the <a href=https://github.com/citizenlab/test-lists/blob/master/lists/global.csv>Global test list</a> to ensure that it gets tested by <a href=https://ooni.org/install>OONI Probe</a> users in Azerbaijan and around the world.

The state prosecutor reportedly accused these websites of sharing content that promotes violence, hatred, extremism, violates privacy and constitutes slander.
