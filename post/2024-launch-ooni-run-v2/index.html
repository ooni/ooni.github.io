Over the past 7 years, OONI Run has been <a href=https://ooni.org/support/ooni-censorship-measurement-campaigns#examples-of-ooni-censorship-measurement-campaigns>used extensively by community members</a> in Venezuela, Malaysia, India, and around the world as part of their censorship measurement campaigns aimed at monitoring and rapidly responding to emergent censorship events. To improve the OONI Run platform and better meet community needs, we previously conducted an <a href=https://ooni.org/post/2020-06-09-ooni-run-usability-study-findings/>OONI Run usability study</a>, through which we documented extensive community feedback.</p><p>We are now excited to launch <a href=https://run.ooni.org/>OONI Run v2</a>, which is a <strong>major revamp</strong> that addresses key <a href=https://ooni.org/post/2020-06-09-ooni-run-usability-study-findings/>community feedback and needs</a>. Specifically, OONI Run v2 includes the following exciting new features:</p><ul><li>Shortened OONI Run links;</li><li>Ability to dynamically update OONI Run links;</li><li>Automated testing of OONI Run links;</li><li>Ability to easily identify, retrieve, and aggregate measurements on <a href=https://explorer.ooni.org/>OONI Explorer</a> from an OONI Run link.</li></ul><p><strong>Update now</strong> to <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.openobservatory.ooniprobe">OONI Probe Android 4.0.0</a> to start using OONI Run v2!</p><p>This blog post shares detailed information about OONI Run v2, as well as how to use it to coordinate censorship testing!

At the time, it was hard for us to imagine just how impactful <a href=https://run.ooni.org/>OONI Run</a> could and would be.</p><p>Our friends from <a href=https://veinteligente.org/>Venezuela Inteligente</a> gave us the idea for OONI Run. In previous years, they shared Raspberry Pis with their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDvVfjJ0Iq8">community of volunteers across Venezuela</a> to run our software, <a href=https://ooni.org/install>OONI Probe</a>, for measuring various forms of internet censorship. The problem though was that OONI Probe would only run at specific times per day, and it would only test certain predetermined lists of websites. As a result, when <a href=https://vesinfiltro.com/>temporary blocks</a> would suddenly emerge – involving websites that were not already included in these predetermined lists – those blocks would not get measured. This raised the need to have the flexibility to more <strong>dynamically determine which websites get tested</strong>, and to have the ability to <strong>enable a distributed community of OONI Probe users to easily and quickly test such websites</strong>.</p><p>We tried to solve this problem through the creation of <a href=https://run.ooni.org/>OONI Run</a>: a web platform that you can use to create mobile deep links to coordinate the <a href=https://ooni.org/install/mobile>OONI Probe</a> testing of websites. You can share these links with a community of volunteers (who are <a href=https://ooni.org/install/mobile>OONI Probe mobile app</a> users) so that they can test the websites of your choice, contributing measurements that are published as <a href=https://ooni.org/data/>open data</a> in real-time.</p><p><a href=https://run.ooni.org/>OONI Run</a> therefore enables <strong>decentralized, community-driven efforts aimed at coordinating the testing of website blocking</strong>. The goal of this platform is to enable community members to independently coordinate on the testing of websites, particularly when new blocks emerge. All test results are published as <a href=https://ooni.org/data/>open data</a> in real-time, supporting <a href=https://ooni.org/reports/>research</a> and <a href=https://www.accessnow.org/keepiton/>advocacy</a> efforts.</p><p>Over the past 7 years, we have seen community members use OONI Run leading up to and during elections, or in response to emergent new blocks during protests or other political events. <a href=https://sinarproject.org/>Sinar Project</a>, for example, used OONI Run to coordinate an <a href=https://sinarproject.org/digital-rights/measuring-and-detecting-network-interference/ge15>OONI censorship measurement campaign in Malaysia</a> to encourage the testing of election-related websites during the country’s 2022 general election.</p><div><a href=/post/2024-launch-ooni-run-v2/images/image23.png><img src=/post/2024-launch-ooni-run-v2/images/image23_hu7399556185341604824.png></a></div><p><strong>Image:</strong> Call to Action for OONI Probe testing of election-related websites during Malaysia’s 2022 general election (source: <a href=https://sinarproject.org/digital-rights/measuring-and-detecting-network-interference/ge15>Sinar Project</a>).</p><p>India’s <a href=https://sflc.in/>Software Freedom Law Centre (SFLC.in)</a> embedded OONI Run widgets into their <a href=https://internetshutdowns.in/>India Internet Shutdown Tracker project</a> website, encouraging long-term OONI Probe testing of news media, blogs, human rights, and political websites in India. <a href=https://veinteligente.org/>Venezuela Inteligente</a> coordinated with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDvVfjJ0Iq8">OONI Probe volunteers in different regions of Venezuela</a> to measure (and respond to) <a href=https://vesinfiltro.com/>temporary website blocks</a> which emerged in correlation with political events. Human rights advocates from the global <a href=https://www.accessnow.org/keepiton/>#KeepItOn campaign</a> used OONI Run leading up to and during political events (such as elections and protests) around the world to collect censorship measurement data in support of their advocacy efforts.</p><p>Community members have also used OONI Run for research purposes. <a href=https://medium.com/@cyberlabukraine>Digital Security Lab Ukraine</a>, for example, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIn-r6JxdEM">coordinated with OONI Probe volunteers in different regions of Ukraine</a> to examine how internet censorship differs from region to region (and network to network) in the country. OTF Information Controls research fellows, Igor Valentovitch and Ksenia Ermoshina, <a href=https://www.opentech.fund/news/exploring-online-media-filtering-during-2018-russian-presidential-elections/>investigated and compared internet censorship in Russia and Crimea</a> during Russia’s 2018 presidential election by coordinating with OONI Probe communities for the testing of their custom lists of websites.</p><h3 id=community-feedback>Community feedback</h3><p>To improve the OONI Run platform and better meet community needs, we previously conducted an <a href=https://ooni.org/post/2020-06-09-ooni-run-usability-study-findings/>OONI Run usability study</a>, through which we documented extensive community feedback.</p><p>With OONI Run v2, we address the <strong>key community feedback and needs</strong> identified through most survey and interview responses collected through our usability study.</p><p>Specifically, the <strong><a href=https://ooni.org/post/2020-06-09-ooni-run-usability-study-findings/#overall-challenges-associated-with-using-ooni-run>main OONI Run challenges</a></strong> that our community highlighted include:</p><ul><li>Long OONI Run links break when shared through various messaging platforms;</li><li>Immutable OONI Run links prevent users from dynamically updating the links;</li><li>Difficulty in ensuring that OONI Run links are run continuously by volunteers;</li><li>Difficulty in finding measurements collected through OONI Run links on <a href=https://explorer.ooni.org/>OONI Explorer</a>.</li></ul><p>Based on these challenges, our community highlighted the following <strong><a href=https://ooni.org/post/2020-06-09-ooni-run-usability-study-findings/#suggestions-for-improving-ooni-run>key needs</a></strong>:</p><ul><li><strong>Shortened OONI Run links.</strong> Shorter OONI Run links would be easier to share, they would not break when shared across platforms, and community members who receive such links would trust them more.</li><li><strong>Ability to dynamically update OONI Run links.</strong> As new blocks emerge, there is the urgent need to enable OONI Run users to update existing OONI Run links (which have already been shared with volunteers) with new URLs (instead of having to create and share new OONI Run links each time).</li><li><strong>Automated testing of OONI Run links.</strong> Reminding volunteers to continually re-run an OONI Run link can be challenging. Community members therefore highlighted the important need to enable the automated testing of OONI Run links to help ensure continuous testing and greater measurement coverage.</li><li><strong>Ability to easily identify, retrieve, and aggregate measurements on OONI Explorer from an OONI Run link.</strong> Once users perform testing with an OONI Run link, the measurements are published as open data in real-time on <a href=https://explorer.ooni.org/>OONI Explorer</a>. However, as OONI Explorer hosts more than 2 billion network measurements, most of which are not from OONI Run measurement campaigns, there is the need to have the ability to easily identify, retrieve, and aggregate measurements collected through a specific OONI Run link.</li></ul><p>We are excited to share that the above needs have been addressed and are supported by <a href=https://run.ooni.org/>OONI Run v2</a>! We also aim to address more community feedback on an ongoing basis.</p><h2 id=ooni-run-v2>OONI Run v2</h2><p>Are you a researcher interested in examining the blocking of specific websites? Are you a journalist or advocate interested in collecting data to confirm the blocking of certain websites in another country?</p><p>If so, OONI Run is for you. You can use OONI Run to <strong>share mobile deep links that enable the censorship testing of websites of your choice</strong> – and contribute test results as <a href=https://ooni.org/data/>open data</a> in real-time.</p><p><a href=https://run.ooni.org/>OONI Run v2</a> helps bring community-driven censorship testing to a whole new level.</p><p>Not only are OONI Run v2 links shorter and easier to share, but you can also customize them based on the message that you want to share with your community of volunteers. You can log into the OONI Run v2 platform to access all of the links you have created, and you can update them on an ongoing basis (without having to create new links!) to include any additional websites that you’d like to see tested. Your community of volunteers who have installed your OONI Run links on their <a href=https://ooni.org/install/mobile>OONI Probe mobile app</a> will automatically receive any updates you make, and the links you have shared will automatically get tested – ensuring ongoing testing and greater measurement coverage. You can find the results from such testing on <a href=https://explorer.ooni.org/>OONI Explorer</a>, where all measurements are published as open data in real-time.</p><p>Excited to start using OONI Run v2?

If the latter, please add an extra <code>s</code> after <code>http</code>.</li><li>Does the <a href=https://ooni.org/support/glossary/#domain-name>domain</a> include <code>www</code>? If so, please include it.</li><li>If the website is on HTTPS (e.g. <a href=https://www.hrw.org/)>https://www.hrw.org/)</a>, you don’t need to specify a webpage (e.g., <code>https://www.hrw.org/publications</code>), since ISPs usually cannot limit blocking to a specific webpage when it’s hosted on HTTPS. Rather, they would have to block access to the entire website.</li></ul><p>To ensure that each URL is typed accurately, <strong>please copy-paste it from a browser</strong>.</p><p>We recommend <strong>creating a list of websites in a text editor</strong>, where each URL is in a separate line.
