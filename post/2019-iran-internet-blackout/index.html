sources, all of which show that it started on 16th November 2019.</p><h2 id=ioda-data>IODA data</h2><p>The <a href=https://ioda.caida.org/>Internet Outage Detection and Analysis (IODA)</a> project of the <a href=https://www.caida.org/>Center for Applied Internet Data Analysis (CAIDA)</a> measures
Internet blackouts worldwide in near real-time.</p><p>IODA data highlights three interesting aspects of Iran’s internet
blackout:</p><ol><li><p>Cellular operators in Iran were disconnected first;</p></li><li><p>Almost all other providers in Iran followed suit over the next 5
hours;</p></li><li><p>Providers appear to have used diverse mechanisms to enforce
the blackout.</p></li></ol><p>In order to track and confirm Internet disruptions with greater
confidence, IODA uses <a href=http://www.caida.org/projects/ioda/>three complementary measurement and inference methods</a>: Routing (BGP)
announcements, Active Probing, and Internet Background Radiation (IBR)
traffic. The routing announcements from BGP allow us to track
<em>control-plane</em> Internet reachability in an area, whereas Active Probing
and IBR shed light on different aspects of <em>data-plane</em> reachability.
These methods result in connectivity “liveness” signals, <strong>whose status
(for each country) is always publicly visible in the <a href=https://ioda.caida.org/ioda/dashboard>IODA dashboard</a></strong>.</p><p>IODA <a href="https://ioda.caida.org/ioda/dashboard#view=inspect&amp;entity=country/IR&amp;lastView=overview&amp;from=1573689600&amp;until=1574380800">data</a>
clearly shows drops in signals from Iran on 16th November 2019, as
illustrated in the figure below.</p><p><img src=/post/2019-iran-internet-blackout/01.png alt="IODA graph: Iran"></p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://ioda.caida.org/ioda/dashboard#view=inspect&amp;entity=country/IR&amp;lastView=overview&amp;from=1573862400&amp;until=1574035200">Internet Outage and Detection Analysis (IODA): Iran (Nov 16 to Nov 18)</a></p><p>Unlike other country-wide blackouts (such as those in
<a href="https://twitter.com/caida_ioda/status/1159660769027321856?s=20">Syria</a>
and
<a href="https://ioda.caida.org/ioda/dashboard#lastView=overview&amp;from=1569888000&amp;until=1571054400&amp;view=inspect&amp;entity=country/IQ">Iraq</a>),
the signal drops did <em>not</em> all occur simultaneously and the magnitude of
the drops across the three different signals varied. For example, the
first drop occurred at around 14:00 UTC (17:30 local time in Iran), when
the BGP signal dropped by 33% (with the number of globally visible /24s
reducing by 15,000). However, the drops that the Active Probing and IBR
signals experienced at that time are almost negligible.</p><p>Then, from around 17:00 UTC on the same day, the Active Probing and IBR
time series dropped steadily until around 19:00 UTC. After 19:00 UTC on
16th November 2019, data-plane connectivity remained low until 09:00 UTC
on the morning of 21st November 2019, after which the Active Probing
time series began a slight trend upwards.</p><p>From the evening of 16th November 2019 to the morning of 21st November
2019, there was significantly reduced data-plane Internet connectivity,
although notably, <strong>some connectivity continued to persist even during
this time</strong>. Control-plane connectivity ostensibly remained at more than
50% of the pre-blackout connectivity throughout this time.</p><p>In the next section, we show that these differences in
signal-drop-patterns among the three IODA data sources are likely due to
both the adoption of diverse disconnection mechanisms and large
differences in the timing of their execution by various Iranian Internet
Service Providers (ISPs).</p><h3 id=network-level-differences>Network-level differences</h3><p>IODA data clearly shows drops in signals for various network operators
in Iran on 16th November 2019, as illustrated below (see legend on the
top-right of the chart to refer to each network operator).</p><p><img src=/post/2019-iran-internet-blackout/02.png alt="Internet blackout in Iran"></p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://ioda.caida.org/ioda/dashboard#view=inspect&amp;entity=country/IR&amp;lastView=overview&amp;from=1573689600&amp;until=1574380800">Internet Outage and Detection Analysis (IODA)</a> <a href=/post/2019-iran-internet-blackout/20191123-ioda-iran-charts.csv>data chart</a> generated using a <a href=https://gist.github.com/hellais/de19a104681402e9b9b63df73dd0f5d7>script</a></p><p>We observe significant differences in how different Autonomous Systems
(ASes) were affected by the shutdown.</p><p>First, there are timing differences—some networks lost Internet
connectivity a few hours before the others. For example, three large
cellular ISPs—MCCI (AS197207), IranCell (AS44244), and Rightel
(AS57218)—lost connectivity at around 14:00 UTC (17:30 local time in
Iran). These observations perhaps indicate that cellular operators in
Iran were instructed to shut down the Internet first (before fixed-line
operators were instructed).</p><p>Other ASes start losing connectivity later in the day at around 17:00
UTC (20:30 local time in Iran), but there are timing differences among
these ASes too. For example, the Active Probing and IBR signals for
Shatel (AS31549) drop sharply at around 17:00 UTC (20:30 local time in
Iran), but these signals for ParsOnline (AS16322) drop an hour later at
around 18:00 UTC (21:30 local time in Iran). These differences in timing
suggest that individual operators enforced the blackout independently
(as opposed to a single “kill-switch” that resulted in the simultaneous
disconnection of all operators).</p><p>Second, we observe dissimilarities in how the network-level blackouts
for different networks manifest in IODA’s signals. These dissimilarities
may reflect the use of different approaches by operators for
disconnecting their networks.</p><p>The three cellular ISPs’ blackouts are visible as drops in BGP
reachability at roughly the same time (~14:00 UTC); these drops are
accompanied by simultaneous drops in the IBR signal for these cellular
ASes as well. These results suggest that cellular operators perhaps
executed the blackout in their networks by blocking control-plane
reachability.</p><p>Other large Iranian ASes’ IODA signals exhibit differences compared to
the cellular ASes’ signals, and these differences are not limited to the
timings at which drops occur. For example, ITC (AS12880) has no drop in
the BGP signal on 16th November 2019, but the Active Probing and IBR
signals drop to nearly 0 at around 18:00 UTC (21:30 local time in Iran)
on that day.</p><p>On the other hand, Iran Telecom Co (AS58224) experiences not one, but
<em>three</em> different drops in the BGP signal (16:30, 18:30, 20:00 UTC),
only two of which are accompanied by drops in the other signals. The
Active Probing and IBR signals for ParsOnline (AS16322) drop to nearly 0
at 18:00 UTC on 16th November 2019, but surprisingly, at around 20:30
UTC on the same day, there is an increase in the IBR signal. These
results show that there can be disparities in the effects of the
blackout across networks.</p><h3 id=signs-of-recovery>Signs of recovery</h3><p>At around 10:00 UTC on 21st November 2019, we observe a spike in Active
Probing measurements.</p><p><img src=/post/2019-iran-internet-blackout/03.png alt="Signs of recovery"></p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://ioda.caida.org/ioda/dashboard#lastView=overview&amp;view=inspect&amp;entity=country/IR&amp;from=1574264400&amp;until=1574380200">Internet Outage and Detection Analysis (IODA): Iran</a>, Recovery of internet outage by network</p><p>At around 10:50 UTC on 23rd November 2019, we can see another uptick in

<a href=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jan/05/iran-clamps-down-internet-use>announced</a>
government plans to launch a national Intranet, the “<a href=https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/bending-internet-iran-brings-national-information-network-online>National Information Network (NIN)</a>”,
which would host Iranian websites and services, and promote Islamic
values.</p><p>Research on Iran’s network infrastructure,
<a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/1209.6398>published</a> in 2012, revealed the
presence of a “hidden Internet”, with private IP addresses allocated on
the country’s national network. Telecommunications entities were found
to allow private addresses to route domestically (whether intentionally
or unintentionally), creating a hidden network only reachable within
Iran. This research also found that records, such as DNS queries,
suggest that servers are assigned both domestic IP addresses and global
ones.</p><p>While it was initially
<a href=https://www.rferl.org/a/irans_national_internet_gets_late_spring_launch_date/24491847.html>reported</a>
that Iran’s Intranet (called
“<a href=https://smallmedia.org.uk/sites/default/files/u8/IIIP_Oct14.pdf>SHOMA</a>”
in Persian) would be launched in 2012, it was <a href=https://advox.globalvoices.org/2016/09/02/iran-declares-unveiling-of-its-national-intranet/>rolled out in August 2016</a>.
Many Iranian Internet users, however, have <a href=https://advox.globalvoices.org/2016/09/02/iran-declares-unveiling-of-its-national-intranet/>reportedly stated</a>
that they either were not aware of Iran’s Intranet, or that they didn’t
take it seriously. The main
<a href=https://advox.globalvoices.org/2016/09/02/iran-declares-unveiling-of-its-national-intranet/>arguments</a>
that the Iranian government has highlighted to get Iranians to use the
Intranet and host their websites there is that it is supposedly faster
and more secure. As part of our recent discussions with Iranian Internet
users, they have claimed that Iran’s Intranet cannot work properly
without the Internet, and that every day electronic devices become more
vulnerable as a result of not receiving updates.</p><p>But amid Iran’s nation-wide Internet blackout, for most Iranians it has
only been possible to access websites and services hosted on Iran’s
Intranet.</p><h1 id=connecting-to-the-internet-from-iran>Connecting to the Internet from Iran</h1><p>Through manual testing, we were able to determine that it could

</code></pre><p>It is possible for Iranian citizens to acquire <strong>virtual private servers
(VPS)</strong> inside the country. Through local testing, we were able to
determine that these VPS hosts have connectivity with both users inside
the country, but also to the Internet. This makes it possible to use
these servers to setup a local proxy inside of the country and to use
that proxy to tunnel traffic to another proxy outside Iran. Information
about this method has also been circulated in <a href=https://t.me/s/webamoozir/6964>Iranian Telegram forums</a>.</p><p><img src=/post/2019-iran-internet-blackout/11.png alt="VPS: Iran"></p><p>However, locals using VPS in Iran to connect to the global Internet
reported that they may have experienced throttling. We do not have
measurement data available to confirm this, but it could be an area for
further research. If VPS traffic is in fact being throttled, it would
<em>not</em> be the first time that <a href=https://arxiv.org/pdf/1306.4361.pdf>Iran has throttled Internet traffic</a>.</p><h1 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h1><p>As <a href=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/11/iran-protests-600-words-191118060831036.html>protests</a>
erupted in Iran, the <a href=https://www.wired.com/story/iran-internet-shutoff/>Internet was shut down on a nation-wide level</a> over the
last week.</p><p>Iran’s nation-wide Internet blackout is confirmed by several data
sources, such as
<a href="https://ioda.caida.org/ioda/dashboard#view=inspect&amp;entity=country/IR&amp;lastView=overview&amp;from=1573689600&amp;until=1574380800">IODA</a>,

and <a href="https://map.internetintel.oracle.com/?root=national&amp;country=IR">Oracle’s Internet Intelligence data</a>.
These data sources show that the Internet blackout in Iran started on
16th November 2019 and has been ongoing. As of 21st November 2019 (and
more drastically from 23rd November 2019), Internet connectivity is
being restored in Iran.</p><p>IODA <a href="https://ioda.caida.org/ioda/dashboard#view=inspect&amp;entity=country/IR&amp;lastView=overview&amp;from=1573689600&amp;until=1574380800">data</a>,
which provides publicly-accessible network-level granularity, shows that
Iranian cellular operators were disconnected first on 16th November 2019
(followed by almost all other operators over the next 5 hours), and that
ISPs appear to have used diverse mechanisms to enforce the blackout. In
an orthogonal study, by analyzing packet captures from the MCCI
(AS197207) network, we found that a RST packet is injected at both ends
of the connection.</p><p>During the blackout, most Iranians were barred from connecting to the
global Internet, but they still had access to Iran’s national intranet:
the domestic network hosting Iranian websites and services. Yet, <a href="https://explorer.ooni.org/search?until=2019-11-23&amp;probe_cc=IR">OONI measurements</a>
(which require Internet connectivity) were collected from multiple
networks in Iran between 16th November 2019 to 23rd November 2019,
showing that the internet blackout was <em>not</em> total.</p><p>To explore whether and how connectivity to the Internet could be
possible from Iran during the blackout, we performed manual testing
locally. We found that <strong>DNS tunneling</strong> could possible be a low
bandwidth solution to get network traffic to leave Iran. We also found
that it was possible to connect to the Internet by using <strong>virtual
private servers (VPS)</strong> to setup a local proxy in Iran and use that
proxy to tunnel traffic to another proxy outside Iran.</p></main></div><footer class=p-4><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-12 col-md-4"><div class=pb-2><img src=/images/logos/ooni-horizontal.svg height=32px alt="OONI Logo"></div><div class=pb-4>Global community measuring internet censorship around the world.</div><div><div>© 2022 Open Observatory of Network Interference (OONI)</div><div><a href=https://github.com/ooni/license>Content available under a Creative Commons
