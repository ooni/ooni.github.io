and detaining the country’s State Counsellor (equivalent to a prime
minister) and other democratically elected leaders.</p><p>A few days after the coup, ISPs in Myanmar started <a href=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-myanmar-politics-facebook-idUSKBN2A32ZE>blocking access to Facebook services</a>.
On 5th February 2021, they started <a href=https://edition.cnn.com/2021/02/05/tech/myanmar-blocks-twitter-instagram/index.html>blocking access to Twitter and Instagram</a>
as well. On 6th February 2021, access to <a href="https://ioda.caida.org/ioda/dashboard#view=inspect&entity=country/MM&lastView=overview&from=1612437274&until=1612782874">the internet was shut down entirely for nearly 30 hours</a>.
When internet connectivity was restored, social media blocks remained in
place and they are currently ongoing. Since 15th February 2021, access
to the internet has been <a href="https://ioda.caida.org/ioda/dashboard#view=inspect&entity=country/MM&lastView=overview&from=1613219264&until=1614774464">shut down every night</a>
(between around 1am to 9am local time) in Myanmar. More recently, some
ISPs in Myanmar appear to have started <a href="https://explorer.ooni.org/search?since=2021-02-01&probe_cc=MM&test_name=web_connectivity&domain=www.wikipedia.org&until=2021-03-05">blocking access to Wikipedia</a>

<a href=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-54899170>won</a> the majority in
Myanmar’s 2020 general election. The NLD governed Myanmar since
<a href=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-33547036>winning the 2015 general election</a>, with <a href=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-pacific-11685977>Aung San Suu Kyi</a>
serving as the country’s State Counsellor (equivalent to a prime
minister). Aung San Suu Kyi was once seen as a beacon for human rights,
having <a href=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-pacific-11685977>won</a> the
Nobel Peace Prize in 1991 amid 15 years in detention for her
pro-democracy struggle. But her <a href=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/11/world/asia/aung-san-suu-kyi-rohingya-myanmar-genocide-hague.html>inaction in response to the genocide of the Muslim Rohingya people in Rakhine State</a>
(which started in October 2016) and her refusal to acknowledge that
Myanmar’s military had committed masacres drew international criticism.</p><p>Observers <a href=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-54899170>questioned</a>
the credibility of the November 2020 election because of the
disenfranchisement of the Rohingya, particularly since Myanmar’s
electoral commission cancelled voting in large parts of Rakhine State
and other conflict-hit states. Nonetheless, the NLD
<a href=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-54899170>reported</a> that the
latest election was a “landslide” victory and announced that it would be
inviting ethnic minority parties to work with it.</p><p>However, the military-backed opposition
<a href=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-54899170>disputed</a> the election
results, accusing the government of irregularities, and demanding a
rerun of the election. The country’s Union Election Commission
determined that the election was done “fairly and free”, and that there
would <em>not</em> be an election re-run.</p><p>In response, military leaders in Myanmar <a href=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-55882489>seized power in a coup</a> on 1st February
2021, detaining Aung San Suu Kyi and other elected leaders. A night-time
curfew has been imposed by the military, and a one-year state of
emergency has been declared. Following the coup, the military instructed
local Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to <a href=https://www.forbes.com/sites/rachelsandler/2021/02/05/social-media-blackout-myanmar-military-government-blocks-twitter-instagram/>block access to social media services</a>,
and to shut down the internet every night (starting from around 1am
local time on 15th February 2021). They have also <a href=https://data.opendevelopmentmyanmar.net/en/dataset/law-amending-the-electronic-transactions-law-15-feb-2021>amended the Electronic Transactions Law</a>,
making the spread of “fake news or disinformation” online punishable by
up to 3 years in prison. The amended Electronic Transactions Law also
includes
<a href=https://www.myanmar-now.org/en/news/amended-law-throws-myanmar-back-into-media-dark-age>provisions</a>
that the military initially tried to introduce in a new cybersecurity
bill drafted shortly after it seized power (but that bill was rejected
by stakeholders in Myanmar). These amendments
<a href=https://www.myanmar-now.org/en/news/amended-law-throws-myanmar-back-into-media-dark-age>reportedly</a>
raise concerns with respect to media freedom, access to information, and
online freedom of expression in Myanmar.</p><h1 id=methods>Methods</h1><p>To investigate the blocking of online platforms, we analyzed <a href="https://explorer.ooni.org/search?since=2021-01-27&probe_cc=MM">OONI measurements collected from Myanmar</a>
(similarly to our previous studies in
<a href=https://ooni.org/post/2020-myanmar-blocks-websites-amid-covid19/>2020</a>
and <a href=https://ooni.org/post/myanmar-report/>2017</a>). OONI measurements
are regularly collected and contributed by users of the <a href=https://ooni.org/install/>OONI Probe app</a>, which is <a href=https://github.com/ooni>free and open source</a>, designed to
<a href=https://ooni.org/nettest/>measure</a> various forms of internet
censorship and network interference.</p><p>More specifically, we limited our analysis to <a href="https://explorer.ooni.org/search?since=2021-01-27&probe_cc=MM">OONI measurements</a>
collected from Myanmar between <strong>1st February 2021 to 25th February
2021</strong> in order to examine how internet censorship has changed in the
country following the military coup. We further limited our analysis to
OONI measurements pertaining to the testing of social media websites and
apps, as well as to the testing of <code>www.wikipedia.org</code>, circumvention
tool websites, news media websites (which we
<a href=https://ooni.org/post/2020-myanmar-blocks-websites-amid-covid19/#blocked-news-outlets>reported</a>
to be blocked last year), <code>www.justiceformyanmar.org</code> and
<code>coronavirus.app</code> (which we found blocked as part of recent OONI data
analysis).</p><p>While a wide range of websites can be tested through <a href=https://ooni.org/nettest/web-connectivity/>OONI’s Web Connectivity test</a>
(designed to measure the TCP/IP, DNS, and HTTP blocking of websites),
the <a href=https://ooni.org/install/>OONI Probe app</a> currently only
includes tests for the following social media apps:
<a href=https://ooni.org/nettest/whatsapp/>WhatsApp</a>, <a href=https://ooni.org/nettest/facebook-messenger/>Facebook Messenger</a>, and
<a href=https://ooni.org/nettest/telegram/>Telegram</a>. Our analysis was
therefore limited to the testing of these specific apps.</p><p>Our findings are also limited by the type and volume of measurements
contributed by volunteer <a href=https://ooni.org/install/>OONI Probe</a> users
in Myanmar (i.e. if a blocked service was not tested in Myanmar in the
analysis period, relevant measurement findings will not be available).</p><p>To explore the internet outages (i.e. when access to the internet was
shut down entirely) in Myanmar, we referred to the following public data
sources: <a href="https://ioda.caida.org/ioda/dashboard#view=inspect&entity=country/MM&lastView=overview&from=1613219264&until=1614774464">Internet Outage Detection and Analysis (IODA)</a>,
<a href="https://map.internetintel.oracle.com/?root=national&country=MM">Oracle’s Internet Intelligence Map</a>,

Our goal was to check whether the signals and timing of the internet
outages in Myanmar can be verified and corroborated by all three
separate public data sources.</p><h1 id=findings>Findings</h1><h2 id=blocking-of-social-media>Blocking of social media</h2><div><a href=/post/2021-myanmar-internet-blocks-and-outages/images/FB-MM.jpeg><img src=/post/2021-myanmar-internet-blocks-and-outages/images/FB-MM_hu03d5a134cdd2accc821f0046a7e78ca1_34360_1000x800_fit_q75_box.jpeg srcset="/post/2021-myanmar-internet-blocks-and-outages/images/FB-MM_hu03d5a134cdd2accc821f0046a7e78ca1_34360_2000x1600_fit_q75_box.jpeg 2x" title="Facebook blocked in Myanmar" alt="Facebook blocked in Myanmar"></a></div><p>Merely three days after the military coup, ISPs in Myanmar started
blocking access to Facebook services.</p><p>On 4th February 2021, OONI data showed that access to
<a href="https://explorer.ooni.org/search?until=2021-02-05&since=2021-01-05&domain=www.facebook.com&probe_cc=MM">facebook.com</a>,

and
<a href="https://explorer.ooni.org/search?until=2021-02-05&since=2021-01-05&probe_cc=MM&test_name=whatsapp">WhatsApp</a>
was blocked on several networks in Myanmar. This was also
<a href=https://www.telenor.com/directive-to-block-social-media-service/>disclosed</a>
by Telenor, who shared that they received a directive from Myanmar’s
Ministry of Transport and Communications on 3rd February 2021 to
temporarily block Facebook. This directive was
<a href=https://www.cnet.com/news/facebook-temporarily-blocked-in-myanmar-after-military-coup/>reportedly</a>
motivated by concerns over the spread of misinformation on Facebook.
Quite similarly, Facebook
<a href=https://edition.cnn.com/2021/02/12/tech/facebook-myanmar-military-intl-hnk/index.html>reportedly</a>
restricted the distribution of content by profiles and accounts run by
Myanmar’s military in an attempt to limit the spread of misinformation.
While it was initially
<a href=https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/myanmar-orders-telecom-networks-to-temporarily-block-facebook/>reported</a>
that Facebook would remain blocked until 7th February 2021, OONI data
<a href="https://explorer.ooni.org/search?since=2021-01-31&domain=www.facebook.com&probe_cc=MM">shows</a>
that access to Facebook services remains blocked on several networks in
Myanmar.</p><p>On 5th February 2021, ISPs in Myanmar appear to have started <a href="https://explorer.ooni.org/search?until=2021-02-14&since=2021-01-15&domain=twitter.com&probe_cc=MM">blocking access to Twitter</a>
as well. Many OONI measurements collected thereafter suggest the ongoing
<a href="https://explorer.ooni.org/search?since=2021-01-31&domain=twitter.com&probe_cc=MM">blocking</a>
of <code>twitter.com</code> on several networks in Myanmar. OONI measurements
also suggest the
<a href="https://explorer.ooni.org/search?since=2021-01-15&domain=www.instagram.com&probe_cc=MM">blocking</a>
of <code>www.instagram.com</code> from 10th February 2021 onwards (though it’s
possible that the blocking may have started earlier, as <a href="https://explorer.ooni.org/search?until=2021-02-14&since=2021-01-15&domain=www.instagram.com&probe_cc=MM">very few measurements</a>

measurement coverage that each social media domain received (across
networks in Myanmar) between 1st February 2021 to 25th February 2021.
The measurements are colour-coded based on the <a href=https://ooni.org/nettest/web-connectivity/>Web Connectivity</a> test results;
it is evident that most measurements presented
<a href=https://ooni.org/support/glossary/#tcp>TCP/IP</a> anomalies, suggesting
the IP blocking of Twitter, Facebook, WhatsApp, and Instagram on most
tested networks in Myanmar.</p><p>In some cases though (on the following 6 networks: AS58952, AS133385,
AS136255, AS63852, AS18399, AS136783), we see these social media sites
blocked in different ways. Measurements that are annotated as
<code>confirmed</code> in the above chart pertain to cases where we were able to
<em>automatically confirm</em> blocking based on the detection of <a href=https://ooni.org/support/glossary/#block-page>block pages</a>. We were able to
confirm blocking because OONI network measurement data
<a href="https://explorer.ooni.org/measurement/20210217T163818Z_webconnectivity_MM_58952_n1_jYRBeNMNDaXRkXAo?input=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com">shows</a>
that those ISPs implemented DNS based interference which returned IP
addresses (59.153.90.11, 167.172.4.60) that host block pages, such as
the following:</p><div><a href=/post/2021-myanmar-internet-blocks-and-outages/images/mm-blockpage.png><img src=/post/2021-myanmar-internet-blocks-and-outages/images/mm-blockpage_hueb12c5e2cd41a09940310480e7aba7f9_57563_1000x800_fit_box_2.png srcset="/post/2021-myanmar-internet-blocks-and-outages/images/mm-blockpage_hueb12c5e2cd41a09940310480e7aba7f9_57563_2000x1600_fit_box_2.png 2x" title="Block page in Myanmar" alt="Block page in Myanmar"></a></div><p><strong>Image:</strong> Block page served in Myanmar.</p><p>It’s worth noting though that the same ISPs which served block pages
through DNS based interference were also found to implement IP based
blocking as well. In other words, OONI data shows that ISPs in Myanmar
adopt a mixture of censorship techniques &ndash; in some cases serving block
pages, while in other cases implementing what looks like IP based
blocking. More details are available through our
<a href=https://gist.github.com/hellais/397af212f267757ab492534cd1bded85>analysis</a>.</p><p>Overall, from the above chart on social media blocking in Myanmar, we
see that:</p><ul><li><p>There was a significant increase in <a href=https://ooni.org/install/>OONI Probe</a> measurement coverage towards
the end of the analysis period;</p></li><li><p>Most measurements present TCP/IP level interference, suggesting IP
based blocking on most networks;</p></li><li><p>Some ISPs blocked a few of these sites by means of DNS interference,
returning IP addresses that host block pages (59.153.90.11,
167.172.4.60) or an address in private IP space (such as 127.0.0.1
or <a href="https://explorer.ooni.org/measurement/20210224T071933Z_webconnectivity_MM_132148_n1_LXbhEGsskbD7xWZA?input=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2F">172.29.8.1</a>);</p></li><li><p>Some measurements were successful (i.e. the tested websites were
found accessible), showing that the blocks are not implemented
deterministically over time on all networks.</p></li></ul><p>While OONI measurements show that <a href="https://explorer.ooni.org/search?since=2021-02-01&probe_cc=MM&test_name=telegram">Telegram has been reachable</a>

of WhatsApp and Facebook, which varies from network to network (and in
some cases, we observe ISPs adopting a mixture of censorship

is in stark contrast to the first Internet outage that occurred during
the coup on 1st February 2021; in the time since, it appears that ISPs

in the early hours of 1st February 2021 (on the day of the

Myanmar has been experiencing <a href="https://ioda.caida.org/ioda/dashboard#view=inspect&entity=country/MM&lastView=overview&from=1613219264&until=1614774464">complete internet outages every night</a>
(between around 1am to 9am local time).</p></li></ul><p>Through <a href="https://explorer.ooni.org/search?until=2021-03-05&since=2021-02-03&probe_cc=MM&only=anomalies">OONI data</a>
(on the blocking of Wikipedia and social media services), we observe the
following:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Censorship variance across networks.</strong> Internet censorship appears
to vary across networks in Myanmar, as we observe different sites
being blocked on different networks (and the blocks are not
implemented on all networks).</p></li><li><p><strong>Variance in censorship techniques.</strong> ISPs in Myanmar are primarily
seen to block sites and apps by means of IP blocking and/or DNS
based interference.</p><ul><li><p><strong>IP blocking.</strong> In many cases, we observe the IP blocking of
websites and apps across networks in Myanmar.</p></li><li><p><strong>DNS based interference.</strong> In some cases, ISPs in Myanmar block
sites by means of DNS based interference, returning IP
addresses that host block pages (59.153.90.11, 167.172.4.60)
or an address in private IP space (such as 127.0.0.1 or
172.29.8.1). We were able to automatically confirm these
censorship cases.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Non-deterministic censorship.</strong> Not all IP blocks appear to be
effective. OONI data
<a href="https://explorer.ooni.org/search?since=2021-02-02&domain=www.wikipedia.org&probe_cc=MM&probe_asn=AS136480&until=2021-03-05">shows</a>
that it is sometimes possible for connections to go through (even
though IP blocks appear to be in place), which is likely why we
observe inconsistent measurements (in terms of accessibility and
blocking).</p></li></ul><p>The findings of this study suggest an <strong>alarming shift in Myanmar’s
internet censorship landscape</strong>. In our <a href=https://ooni.org/post/myanmar-report/>2017 study</a> (which examined internet
censorship in Myanmar based on the analysis of all OONI measurements
collected between 2016-2017), we barely found any internet censorship in
the country. Now, the ongoing social media blocks and nightly internet
outages raise major human rights concerns, particularly in light of the
current political environment.</p><h1 id=acknowledgements>Acknowledgements</h1><p>We thank <a href=https://ooni.org/install/>OONI Probe</a> users in Myanmar for
