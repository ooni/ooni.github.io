were held in Togo. These elections follow a <a href=https://www.acleddata.com/2018/12/13/togo-another-wave-of-demonstrations-washes-over-gnassingbes-regime/>wave of protests</a>
over the last years against the 53-year rule of Gnassingbe Eyadema and,

collected by <a href=https://ooni.org/install/>OONI Probe</a> users in Togo
suggest that WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, and Telegram were blocked on
two networks: Togo Telecom (AS24691) and Atlantique Telecom (AS37229).
All three apps, however, were accessible on the Canalbox (AS36924)
network, showing that blocking differed across ISPs in Togo.</p><p>The following chart illustrates the results from the testing of
WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, and Telegram across three ISPs in Togo
between 21st to 23rd February 2020.</p><p><img src=/post/2020-togo/tg-chart.png alt="Chart: Blocking of Instant Messaging Apps in Togo"></p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://explorer.ooni.org/search?until=2020-02-23&probe_cc=TG">OONI measurements collected from Togo</a>

(rather than “confirmed blocked”) due to their relatively limited
volume. Yet, the fact that <a href="https://explorer.ooni.org/search?until=2020-02-25&probe_cc=TG&probe_asn=AS24691">OONI measurements</a>
show that these instant messaging apps were accessible in Togo before
and after the elections (from 24th February 2020) suggests that they
were most likely blocked on election day indeed.</p><h2 id=whatsapp>WhatsApp</h2><p>OONI’s <a href=https://ooni.org/nettest/whatsapp/>WhatsApp test</a> is designed
to measure the blocking of WhatsApp’s mobile app and web version
(web.whatsapp.com) by attempting to perform an <a href=https://ooni.org/support/glossary/#http-request>HTTP GET request</a>, <a href=https://ooni.org/support/glossary/#tcp>TCP connection</a>, and <a href=https://ooni.org/support/glossary/#dns-lookup>DNS lookup</a> to WhatsApp’s

networks on 22nd February 2020, suggesting that access to the WhatsApp
mobile app was blocked by means of <strong>IP-based blocking</strong>.</p><p>It’s worth highlighting that the IP addresses used by WhatsApp that
appeared to be blocked in Togo (the 34.192.0.0/10 netblock) are part of
the <a href=https://aws.amazon.com/>Amazon AWS Cloud</a>, which means that the
block could have potentially led to interference of other services
reliant on the Amazon Cloud.</p><p><img src=/post/2020-togo/tg-aws.jpeg alt="AWS IPs"></p><p>But even if some collateral damage did occur, it was probably
short-lived, as recent OONI measurements show that access to WhatsApp

<a href="http://explorer.ooni.org/search?until=2020-02-26&probe_cc=TG">measurements</a>
collected from Togo on 22nd February 2020 suggest the <a href=https://explorer.ooni.org/measurement/20200222T165239Z_AS24691_5WcQoZyep2HktNd8UvKf1Ka4C3WPyOc9AQP79zoJ7oPgyDwSWh>blocking of the WhatsApp mobile app</a>
and <a href=https://explorer.ooni.org/measurement/20200222T165321Z_AS24691_dmMnrhU4civBhYlDoqrvwGysYFiM7iE6MrLw6aXjUELeKMU5pj>Telegram Web</a>,
as well as the <a href=https://explorer.ooni.org/measurement/20200222T165405Z_AS24691_q2DZDwOz7oHJAVbDKnByjajL7Wq2u9s627catBvfec8LuPFiQL>potential blocking of Facebook Messenger</a>.
All three instant messaging platforms appear to have been blocked on the
Togo Telecom (AS24691) and Atlantique Telecom (AS37229) networks, but
were accessible on the Canalbox (AS36924) network. This suggests that
internet censorship varies across networks in Togo.</p><p>As the <a href=https://explorer.ooni.org/measurement/20200222T165239Z_AS24691_5WcQoZyep2HktNd8UvKf1Ka4C3WPyOc9AQP79zoJ7oPgyDwSWh>blocking of WhatsApp endpoints</a>
involved IP addresses that are part of the Amazon AWS Cloud, the block
might have potentially led to interference of other services reliant on
the Amazon Cloud. However, the block was
<a href=http://explorer.ooni.org/measurement/20200225T083431Z_AS24691_RXtDJ0jjszvfluWRn4AT7nWVO6NSyzcpjlkbiLOEzJLPB1Zzgf>lifted</a>
by 24th February 2020, suggesting that any potential collateral damage
was probably short-lived. Similarly, OONI measurements show that
<a href=http://explorer.ooni.org/measurement/20200225T083442Z_AS24691_sTD2ScACS9kkcwAyqn7T7X722wP0EXA3wSHSHD18xUakNqLVd1>Telegram Web</a>

are accessible across networks in Togo from 24th February 2020 onwards.</p><p>As the network anomalies observed for WhatsApp, Telegram Web, and
Facebook Messenger in Togo are mostly limited to 22nd February 2020, the
platforms may have been blocked in correlation to the country’s
<a href=https://www.dw.com/en/togo-president-gnassingb%C3%A9-wins-re-election/a-52494760>presidential election</a>
on that day.</p><p>Longitudinal data is essential to enable the examination of censorship
events over time. To more accurately observe censorship changes and
spikes in correlation to political events (such as Togo’s recent
elections), it is necessary to collect relevant measurements on an
ongoing basis over time.</p><p>You can contribute measurements from Togo or anywhere else around the
world by <a href=https://ooni.org/install/>running OONI Probe</a>, which is
free and open source software designed to measure various forms of
internet censorship, such as the blocking of websites and instant
messaging apps. Network measurement data collected by OONI Probe users
around the world is <a href=https://ooni.org/data/>openly published in near real-time</a>, which you can use as part of your
research and advocacy.</p><p>We thank all <a href=https://ooni.org/install/>OONI Probe</a> users in Togo for
