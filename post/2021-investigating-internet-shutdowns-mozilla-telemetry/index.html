unintentionally) been shut down in a country? We often hear of Internet
shutdowns occurring worldwide from media reports and <a href=https://www.accessnow.org/keepiton/>advocacy campaigns</a>, but which data sources
can we refer to?</p><p>There are a number of public datasets that shed light on whether access
to the Internet has been shut down in a country. Some of these datasets
(such as <a href=https://ioda.caida.org/ioda/dashboard>IODA</a>) are
specifically designed to measure Internet outages, but you can also
potentially
<a href=https://ooni.org/post/2021-uganda-general-election-blocks-and-outage/#social-media>infer</a>
the presence of Internet shutdowns through the <em>absence</em> of data from
other Internet-wide measurement datasets (such as <a href=https://www.ripe.net/manage-ips-and-asns/db>RIPE data</a>, <a href=https://www.measurementlab.net/data/>M-Lab data</a> and, in some cases, <a href=https://ooni.org/data/>OONI data</a>). If an Internet-wide measurement dataset
contains a stable volume of data from a specific network over a long
period of time, a drop in volume of data could potentially signal the
absence of Internet connectivity.</p><p><a href=https://metrics.torproject.org/>Tor Metrics</a> show the number of
directly connecting <a href=https://www.torproject.org/>Tor</a> users from a
given country. Similarly, the <a href=https://psix.ca/>Psiphon Data Engine</a>
shares the number of daily <a href=https://psiphon.ca/>Psiphon</a> users from
each country. If the number of Tor or Psiphon users drops dramatically
to almost no users, that may be a signal that the country in question is
experiencing an Internet shutdown (since Internet connectivity is
required to use Tor and Psiphon). But in the case of Tor and Psiphon
(which are censorship circumvention tools), a drop in their usage may
also be the result of their blocking (as governments tend to block
circumvention tools in an attempt to prevent censorship circumvention),
rather than a country-wide Internet connectivity shutdown.</p><p>This highlights the need to check whether drops in Internet connectivity
signals are present in <em>multiple independent datasets</em> for the same
country, during the same time period. It also suggests that it’s useful
to check <em>Internet traffic towards popular services</em>, which governments
are less likely to shut down.</p><p>As Google services are widely used in most countries, <a href=https://transparencyreport.google.com/traffic/overview>Google traffic data</a> (which
illustrates the volume of Internet traffic towards Google products and
services) is a great example of this. A significant drop in Google
traffic (in comparison to previous levels in that country) often
<a href=https://ooni.org/post/2019-iran-internet-blackout/#other-data-sources>provides a signal of an Internet connectivity shutdown</a>
(as Internet access is required to use Google products and services).
However, Google currently publishes its datasets aggregated at the
granularity of entire countries, precluding the ability to detect
Internet connectivity shutdowns that target a specific sub-national
region or a network within a country.</p><p>With <a href=https://data.firefox.com/dashboard/user-activity>more than 200 million users</a> worldwide
every month, can Mozilla telemetry &ndash; gathered only from Firefox web
browser users who have data reporting enabled &ndash; be another useful
source for investigating and potentially corroborating Internet
connectivity shutdowns worldwide?</p><p>To evaluate this question, Mozilla provided us access to <a href=https://github.com/mozilla/bigquery-etl/blob/main/sql/moz-fx-data-shared-prod/internet_outages/global_outages_v1/metadata.yaml>specific aggregated data points</a>
(which did <em>not</em> contain any personal information) about network
activity from Firefox telemetry in a dataset which spans from January
2020 to date.</p><p>We selected 4 case studies based on countries
(<a href=https://ooni.org/post/2021-myanmar-internet-blocks-and-outages/>Myanmar</a>,
<a href=https://ooni.org/post/2021-uganda-general-election-blocks-and-outage/>Uganda</a>,
<a href=https://ooni.org/post/2020-belarus-internet-outages-website-censorship/>Belarus</a>,
<a href=https://ioda.caida.org/ioda/2020-iran-report>Iran</a>) where Internet
shutdowns are known to have occurred (based on public datasets and
reports) from January 2020 onwards (the starting date of Mozilla
telemetry that we have access to).</p><p>Ultimately, with this study we aim to evaluate how useful Mozilla
telemetry is for the Internet freedom community in researching Internet
connectivity shutdown events worldwide.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> We use the terms “outages” and “shutdowns” interchangeably to
refer to the complete disruption of Internet connectivity. The partial
shutdown of specific Internet services (such as the blocking of apps) is
out of scope in this study because Mozilla telemetry does not involve
such tests.</p><h1 id=methods>Methods</h1><p>To evaluate whether Mozilla telemetry can be helpful in examining
Internet connectivity shutdowns, we:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Selected case studies.</strong> The case studies were chosen based on
countries that are known to have experienced Internet connectivity
shutdowns within the Mozilla telemetry date range that we have
access to (from January 2020 to date).</p></li><li><p><strong>Analyzed Mozilla telemetry.</strong> Our analysis involved the 4
countries (Myanmar, Uganda, Belarus, Iran) that we selected as
case studies.</p></li><li><p><strong>Compared Mozilla telemetry with other public datasets.</strong> We
compared public data (such as <a href=https://ioda.caida.org/ioda/dashboard>IODA</a> and <a href=https://transparencyreport.google.com/traffic/overview>Google traffic data</a>)
with Mozilla telemetry on the selected case studies.</p></li></ul><p>Based on this comparison, our goal was to explore whether it is possible
to observe signals of Internet connectivity shutdowns through Mozilla
telemetry within the date ranges of selected case studies. We also aimed
to understand the potential strengths and limitations of Mozilla
telemetry in examining Internet connectivity shutdowns.</p><h2 id=case-studies>Case studies</h2><p>We selected case studies to explore whether signals of Internet
connectivity outages are visible in Mozilla telemetry.</p><p>Our criteria for selecting these case studies include:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Date range of Mozilla telemetry.</strong> The date range of Mozilla
telemetry that we have access to spans from January 2020 to date.
We therefore needed to select cases of Internet outages that
occurred from January 2020 onwards.</p></li><li><p><strong>Countries that are known to have experienced Internet connectivity
shutdowns from January 2020 onwards.</strong> To compare Mozilla
telemetry with other public data sources, we selected countries
that are known to have experienced Internet connectivity shutdowns
(based on media reports and signals from relevant public datasets)
during the Mozilla telemetry date range.</p></li><li><p><strong>Internet connectivity shutdown cases that occurred during
political events.</strong> When access to the Internet is shut down
during a political event (such as elections or protests), it is
possible that such a shutdown was <em>intentional</em> and that its
timing had a larger public impact. It is therefore important to
monitor such shutdown events (which are more relevant from a
socio-political perspective) and to evaluate whether they are
visible through Mozilla telemetry.</p></li><li><p><strong>Internet connectivity shutdowns previously reported by OONI and/or
IODA.</strong> We further narrowed our case study selection to Internet
shutdown events that OONI and/or IODA had already
<a href=https://ooni.org/reports/>reported</a> on from January 2020
onwards. Having previously performed relevant analysis and
published reports, such case studies enabled us to have a more
in-depth understanding, facilitating more accurate comparison with
Mozilla telemetry. However, we acknowledge our bias in our case
study selection.</p></li></ul><p>Based on these criteria, we selected the following case studies:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Myanmar.</strong> We examine two <a href=https://ooni.org/post/2021-myanmar-internet-blocks-and-outages/#ongoing-nightly-outages>Internet outages</a>
that occurred following the February 2021 military coup.</p></li><li><p><strong>Uganda.</strong> We examine the <a href=https://ooni.org/post/2021-uganda-general-election-blocks-and-outage/#internet-outage-amid-2021-general-election>4-day nationwide Internet outage</a>
amid its January 2021 general election.</p></li><li><p><strong>Belarus.</strong> We examine the <a href=https://ooni.org/post/2020-belarus-internet-outages-website-censorship/#internet-outages-amid-2020-belarusian-presidential-election>Internet outages amid its 2020 presidential election</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Iran.</strong> We examine two <a href=https://ioda.caida.org/ioda/2020-iran-report>Internet outages in March 2020</a> following its
February 2020 legislative election.</p></li></ol><h2 id=analysis-of-mozilla-telemetry>Analysis of Mozilla telemetry</h2><p>For the purpose of this research, Mozilla provided us access to an
<a href=https://github.com/mozilla/bigquery-etl/blob/main/sql/moz-fx-data-shared-prod/internet_outages/global_outages_v1/metadata.yaml>aggregated dataset</a>
of network activity based on Firefox web browser usage worldwide. This
telemetry dataset spans from January 2020 to date.</p><p><a href=https://github.com/mozilla/bigquery-etl/blob/main/sql/moz-fx-data-shared-prod/internet_outages/global_outages_v1/metadata.yaml>Mozilla telemetry data</a>
is only collected from
<a href=https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/>Firefox</a> browser users
who have data reporting enabled, reporting information on certain
networking related metadata when browsing the web. As such, Mozilla
telemetry provides a representation of the user experience when
accessing the web. This telemetry has been aggregated to build privacy
protections in the data.</p><p>The telemetry dataset which has been made available to us is an
aggregate of pings sent by Firefox clients.</p><p>A row of the data looks something like this:</p><pre tabindex=0><code>country,city,datetime,proportion_undefined,proportion_timeout,proportion_abort,proportion_unreachable,proportion_terminated,proportion_channel_open,avg_dns_success_time,missing_dns_success,avg_dns_failure_time,missing_dns_failure,count_dns_failure,ssl_error_prop,avg_tls_handshake_time
</code></pre><p>Each row represents the various aggregate metrics (percentage of
failures, timing information, counts) over a window of 1 hour in a
specific country or city. The aggregation is performed on an hourly
basis, but cities which have less than or equal to 50 hourly active
users are filtered out.</p><p>To analyze Mozilla telemetry as part of this study, we queried the
dataset based on the 4 countries that we selected as case studies. For
each country, we queried the dataset based on the date range(s) of the
Internet shutdown events (selected as part of the case studies). We then
checked whether we could observe a drop in metrics or a complete absence
of metrics within that date range (in comparison to previous levels
before and after the Internet shutdown event), which could provide a
signal of a potential Internet outage. We also checked whether we could
observe a spike in connection timeouts (or other errors), which could
signal a disruption in Internet connectivity (in cases where the
Internet shutdown does not affect all networks in a country).</p><p>Based on our analysis of Mozilla telemetry, we produced relevant charts,
which we share in the Findings section below.</p><h3 id=limitations>Limitations</h3><p>The Mozilla dataset provides location granularity in terms of
<code>country</code> and <code>city</code>, which is very useful for potentially detecting
localized Internet outages that only affect specific cities or regions
(such as the <a href=https://internetshutdowns.in/>Internet shutdowns in Jammu and Kashmir</a>). However, it does not provide
<a href=https://ooni.org/support/glossary/#asn>Autonomous System Number (ASN)</a> level information, which
is essential for identifying the specific AS network that is impacted by
an Internet outage. In Iran, for example, we observed <a href=https://ooni.org/post/2019-iran-internet-blackout/#network-level-differences>network-level differences</a>
during the nationwide Internet shutdown in November 2019. The absence of
ASN information in Mozilla telemetry therefore presents a limitation in
detecting Internet shutdowns that only occur on certain networks.</p><p>The <code>datetime</code> column in Mozilla telemetry indicates when the metric
was submitted to Mozilla’s telemetry backend, but <em>not</em> the time in
which that particular metric was computed on the client. As clients will
store and attempt to re-transmit the metrics at a later stage, these two
times can vary quite dramatically during an Internet outage event. This
therefore presents a limitation in evaluating the correct timing of a
metric.</p><p>As part of this study, the primary metric we used for detecting an
outage event is the number of distinct locations that are able to submit
telemetry data to Mozilla servers. But when looking at other metrics,
such as the average percentage of connection timeouts, the exact timing
of when these metrics were recorded is quite unclear. Moreover, Mozilla
telemetry is aggregated on an hourly basis, which presents the risk of
missing short-lived Internet connectivity shutdowns (which last less
than an hour).</p><p>Given that Mozilla telemetry is aggregated and doesn’t contain
information on the testing of endpoints, we cannot use it to examine the
blocking of specific Internet services (and, therefore, cannot compare
it against <a href=https://ooni.org/data/>OONI measurement data</a>). Rather,
Mozilla telemetry is more useful for examining Internet connectivity
shutdowns by checking whether a dramatic drop or absence of metrics is
visible during a reported Internet shutdown event.</p><h2 id=comparison-of-mozilla-telemetry-with-other-public-datasets>Comparison of Mozilla telemetry with other public datasets</h2><p><a href=https://ooni.org/support/glossary/#false-positive>False positives</a>
can occur (particularly in Internet measurement data), and datasets
usually present limitations.</p><p><a href=https://ioda.caida.org/ioda/dashboard>IODA</a> signals, for example,
may miss certain Internet outages (particularly if they only affect
cellular networks), while <a href=https://transparencyreport.google.com/traffic/overview>Google traffic data</a> may not
reflect Internet outages that only impact certain networks or regions.
Mozilla telemetry shares city-level granularity (which
<a href=https://ioda.caida.org/ioda/dashboard>IODA</a> does not), but does not
provide network-level granularity (which
<a href=https://ioda.caida.org/ioda/dashboard>IODA</a> does). The absence (or
dramatic drop) of <a href=https://metrics.torproject.org/>Tor</a> or
<a href=https://psix.ca/>Psiphon</a> metrics may signal the presence of an
Internet outage, or that may be the result of those tools being blocked
in the specific country.</p><p>In short, it is necessary to adopt a more holistic approach, examining
potential Internet connectivity shutdowns through the <em>comparison of
relevant datasets</em>.</p><p>We therefore compared Mozilla telemetry with other public datasets for
the selected case studies of this research. Based on the analysis of
Mozilla telemetry, we checked whether we could observe a significant
drop in metrics or a complete absence of metrics within the date range
of a selected case study, in comparison to metrics for the same country
and date range in other public datasets (such as
<a href=https://ioda.caida.org/ioda/dashboard>IODA</a> and <a href=https://transparencyreport.google.com/traffic/overview>Google traffic data</a>).</p><p>Our hypothesis is that if we observe a similar drop or absence of
metrics in Mozilla telemetry in comparison to other relevant public
datasets (for the same country and date range), Mozilla telemetry can be
a useful data source for examining Internet connectivity shutdowns.
However, if we do not observe a significant drop or absence of metrics
in Mozilla telemetry, that may reflect limitations to the dataset,
and/or suggest that the Internet outage in question did not have a large
impact (if Firefox clients were still able to submit metrics). The
hourly granularity of Mozilla telemetry (as opposed to being near
real-time) may also present the risk of short-term outages (that last
less than 1 hour) not being recorded.</p><h1 id=investigating-internet-shutdowns>Investigating Internet shutdowns</h1><p>To evaluate whether Mozilla telemetry can be useful in investigating
Internet connectivity shutdowns, we analyzed Mozilla telemetry and
compared it against relevant public datasets involving 4

Some networks experienced almost complete loss of Internet connectivity,
while others appear to have only experienced small outages.</p><p>For the purpose of confirming the outage, we looked at the number of

February 2021) to Mozilla telemetry data, we can see that the outage is
<em>not</em> very visible in the overall metrics count chart (which looks at
how many locations in a given hour were able to report back metrics to
the telemetry server).</p><div><a href=/post/2021-investigating-internet-shutdowns-mozilla-telemetry/images/02.png><img src=/post/2021-investigating-internet-shutdowns-mozilla-telemetry/images/02_hu16069774823957274201.png title="Mozilla telemetry from Myanmar" alt="Mozilla telemetry from Myanmar"></a></div><p><strong>Source:</strong> Mozilla telemetry data from Myanmar (24th January 2021 to

this data is presented with a lag because the timestamp of Mozilla

indicate that this outage only affected a <em>subset</em> of all networks in
the country, as several clients were still able to submit metrics during

hypothesis, as it

amid its 2020 presidential election, we tried to understand why Mozilla
telemetry does not display the third Internet outage that both <a href="https://ioda.caida.org/ioda/dashboard#view=inspect&entity=country/BY&lastView=overview&from=1596114973&until=1598534173">IODA data</a>

display in the evening of 11th August 2020. To this end, we looked at
the average proportion of timed out connections, as well as the average
proportion of connections reporting the network as being unreachable.</p><p>Based on this analysis, we produced the following chart, which includes
Mozilla telemetry from Belarus on both the average proportion of
connection timeouts and the average proportion of unreachable
connections.</p><div><a href=/post/2021-investigating-internet-shutdowns-mozilla-telemetry/images/15.png><img src=/post/2021-investigating-internet-shutdowns-mozilla-telemetry/images/15_hu17018647879521570673.png title="Mozilla telemetry from Belarus" alt="Mozilla telemetry from Belarus"></a></div><p><strong>Source:</strong> Mozilla telemetry data from Belarus (August 2020): Custom
charts showing the average proportion of connection timeouts and the
average proportion of unreachable connections.</p><p>Starting on 10th August 2020 (as illustrated above), we observe a spike
in the average proportion of connections timing out. As some telemetry
continued to be submitted during this period nonetheless, it may be
indicative of an unreliable connection. The high rate of connection
timeouts appears to persist until at least 23:00 UTC on 12th August
2020, which is consistent with the duration of the outage observed in
<a href="https://ioda.caida.org/ioda/dashboard#view=inspect&entity=country/BY&lastView=overview&from=1596114973&until=1598534173">IODA</a>

correspond to the exact time when the metric was collected, but to when
the metric was submitted to Mozilla telemetry servers. A Mozilla metric
may therefore refer to a prior period.</p><p>As for why we see this unusual pattern in Mozilla telemetry, we have the
following observations and hypothesis. It could be that the outages were
not “total”, but instead transitioned to being instances of throttling.
Moreover, a partial outage may have resulted in certain users
experiencing poor Internet connectivity for some time. It might be the
case that one of the upstream ISPs for certain users was out and some
backup routes had to be used.</p><p>The hypothesis of the upstream ISP going down and backup routes being
used is suggested by the fact that we observe an increase in locations
submitting telemetry data during the period of the outage, as
illustrated below.</p><div><a href=/post/2021-investigating-internet-shutdowns-mozilla-telemetry/images/16.png><img src=/post/2021-investigating-internet-shutdowns-mozilla-telemetry/images/16_hu17036290657387508296.png title="Mozilla telemetry from Belarus" alt="Mozilla telemetry from Belarus"></a></div><p><strong>Source:</strong> Mozilla telemetry data from Belarus (August 2020): Custom
chart showing the submission of telemetry by region in Belarus.</p><p>As is evident through the above chart, there are certain locations that
only appear to report Mozilla telemetry data during the period of the
outage. This indicates that there might have been some reshaping of the
network topology during the outage, leading to us to see users exit from
different locations.</p><p>Overall, Mozilla telemetry provides a strong signal of the first two
Internet outages (on 9th and 10th August 2020) in Belarus, similarly to
<a href="https://ioda.caida.org/ioda/dashboard#view=inspect&entity=country/BY&lastView=overview&from=1596114973&until=1598534173">IODA</a>

The third outage (on 11th August 2020), however, is not directly visible
through Mozilla telemetry, but can potentially be inferred through the
spike in connection timeouts and unreachable connections. The fact that
we see an increase in such metrics from a variety of different locations
in Belarus (possibly as a result of network topology reshaping) on 11th
August 2020 adds to the overall Mozilla metric count, making it harder
to spot an outage on that day (in comparison to previous days).</p><h2 id=iran>Iran</h2><p>Iran <a href=https://ioda.caida.org/ioda/2020-iran-report>experienced two Internet outages</a> in March 2020,

of connection timeouts from Iran in March 2020.</p><div><a href=/post/2021-investigating-internet-shutdowns-mozilla-telemetry/images/19.png><img src=/post/2021-investigating-internet-shutdowns-mozilla-telemetry/images/19_hu17564695547903836777.png title="Mozilla telemetry from Iran" alt="Mozilla telemetry from Iran"></a></div><p><strong>Source:</strong> Mozilla telemetry data from Iran (February to March 2020):
Custom charts showing the number of distinct locations submitting
telemetry data and average proportion of connection timeouts from Iran.</p><p>However, as is evident from the above charts, we do not notice any
visible drop in the number of locations submitting Mozilla telemetry
data during the affected periods (3rd and 11th March 2020). This is
likely due to the fact that Mozilla telemetry is aggregated on an hourly
basis, therefore missing short-lived Internet outages that last less
than an hour.</p><p>It’s interesting to note though that while we don’t notice any anomalies
in the average proportion of connection timeouts during the first outage
(3rd March 2020), there is a visible spike during the second outage
(11th March 2020), even though it lasted far less (not even 10 minutes).
The reason for this remains quite unclear to us. However, we theorize
that it is possible that the second outage may have been caused by a
DDoS attack that targeted a major upstream provider, resulting in
increased latency (and therefore more connection timeouts). The first
outage may have had some other cause which isn’t evident in Mozilla
telemetry data.</p><p>It’s also worth mentioning that short-lived Internet shutdowns are
commonly not seen in other datasets either. <a href="https://transparencyreport.google.com/traffic/overview?hl=en&fraction_traffic=start:1582934400000;end:1584316799999;product:19;region:IR&lu=fraction_traffic">Google traffic
data</a>,
for example, does not present any significant signs of disruption in
Iran during this period.</p><h1 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h1><p>Mozilla telemetry is very useful for examining Internet connectivity
shutdowns.</p><p>Through the case studies of this research, we were able to detect strong
signals in Mozilla telemetry on <strong>high impact Internet connectivity
shutdowns</strong> (such as those observed in
<a href=https://ooni.org/post/2021-uganda-general-election-blocks-and-outage/#internet-outage-amid-2021-general-election>Uganda</a>
and
<a href=https://ooni.org/post/2021-myanmar-internet-blocks-and-outages/#outage-on-6th-february-2021>Myanmar</a>
earlier this year). In those cases, access to the Internet was shut down
entirely. As a result, we observe a complete absence of Mozilla
telemetry, strongly suggesting the presence of an Internet connectivity
shutdown. If researchers observe the same absence of metrics (for the
same country and date range) in other (relevant) public datasets as well
(such as <a href=https://ioda.caida.org/ioda/dashboard>IODA</a> and <a href=https://transparencyreport.google.com/traffic/overview>Google
traffic data</a>),
they have greater confidence in confirming an Internet shutdown event.</p><p>We were also able to observe lower impact Internet shutdowns through the
analysis of Mozilla telemetry. In
<a href=https://ooni.org/post/2020-belarus-internet-outages-website-censorship/#internet-outages-amid-2020-belarusian-presidential-election>Belarus</a>,
for example, the drop in Mozilla metrics on 9th and 10th August 2020
(amid the presidential election) provided a signal of Internet
disruptions, which we corroborated with other public datasets. However,
a third Internet disruption (on 11th August 2020), which is visible in
both
<a href="https://ioda.caida.org/ioda/dashboard#view=inspect&entity=country/BY&lastView=overview&from=1596114973&until=1598534173">IODA</a>
and <a href="https://transparencyreport.google.com/traffic/overview?fraction_traffic=start:1595894400000;end:1598572799999;product:19;region:BY&lu=fraction_traffic">Google traffic data</a>,
is not visible in Mozilla telemetry. Yet, we observe a spike in
connection timeouts and unreachable connections in Mozilla telemetry on
that day from many more locations in Belarus, which might suggest that
there may have been some reshaping of the network topology during the
outage.</p><p>In
<a href=https://ooni.org/post/2021-myanmar-internet-blocks-and-outages/#internet-outages>Myanmar</a>,
while Mozilla telemetry provides a strong signal of a <a href=https://ooni.org/post/2021-myanmar-internet-blocks-and-outages/#outage-on-6th-february-2021>high impact Internet shutdown on 6th February 2021</a>,
the <a href=https://ooni.org/post/2021-myanmar-internet-blocks-and-outages/#outage-on-1st-february-2021>lower impact Internet shutdown of 1st February 2021</a>
(which only affected certain networks for a shorter period of time) is
not very visible in Mozilla telemetry. We could, however, <strong>potentially
infer the shutdown from the high percentage of connection timeouts</strong> in
Mozilla telemetry from Myanmar on 1st February 2021.</p><p>In <a href=https://ioda.caida.org/ioda/2020-iran-report#outages>Iran</a>,
Mozilla telemetry does not provide signals of the two short-lived
Internet outages that occurred on 3rd and 11th March 2020 (both of which
lasted for less than an hour). This is likely due to the fact that
Mozilla telemetry is aggregated in hourly buckets, therefore missing
short-lived Internet outages.</p><p>Overall, Mozilla telemetry (in its current form) appears to be a useful
data source primarily for examining high impact Internet connectivity
shutdowns, which involve the complete shutdown of all Internet access in
a country. The high average proportion rate of connection timeouts in
Mozilla telemetry can also provide a signal of lower impact Internet
connectivity shutdowns (when they only affect certain networks, and/or
are short-lived), particularly when compared with other relevant data
sources. The geographical granularity in Mozilla telemetry data
potentially provides research opportunities to explore the reshaping of
network topology.</p><h2 id=recommendations>Recommendations</h2><p>Following our analysis of Mozilla telemetry for this study, we provide
the following friendly recommendations to Mozilla for enhancing the
research and advocacy use of the Mozilla dataset for the Internet
freedom community.</p><p>Our recommendations include:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Publish Mozilla telemetry as open data.</strong> By making a dataset of
Mozilla telemetry openly available, Mozilla will support research
and <a href=https://www.accessnow.org/keepiton/>advocacy</a> efforts to
investigate Internet connectivity shutdowns worldwide. Mozilla
telemetry can potentially offer evidence of an Internet
connectivity shutdown.</p></li><li><p><strong>Provide AS-level aggregation.</strong> Often, Internet shutdowns around
the world only affect certain networks. Such shutdown events are
currently hard to detect through Mozilla’s current dataset, which
does not provide AS-level aggregation. ASN information would
enable researchers and advocates to investigate which networks are
affected by outages, and to confirm lower impact Internet
connectivity shutdowns.</p></li><li><p><strong>Aggregate by collection time rather than submission time.</strong>
Currently, Mozilla data is aggregated by the time data was
received by the ingestion pipeline, rather than when it’s
collected. This presents an important research limitation because,
in the absence of a working connection to the Mozilla telemetry
service, data might be stored and submitted up to 90 days later
compared to when the measurement was gathered by the device.</p></li></ol><h1 id=acknowledgements>Acknowledgements</h1><p>We thank Mozilla for providing us access to Mozilla telemetry for this
