As of May 2023, OONI is a non-profit organization registered in Rome, Italy.</p><p>We are excited about this development as it marks a new era of growth for OONI.</p><p>While OONI was born more than a decade ago in 2011-2012, it started off as a small project under the <a href=https://www.torproject.org/>Tor Project</a>. At the time, internet censorship started to increase in several countries during the Arab Spring, and Tor Project developers (including Arturo Filastò, OONI’s founder) were eager to understand how access to the Tor network was being blocked (to support circumvention efforts). To this end, they developed various scripts to measure Tor blocking. This resulted in the following ideas: What if anyone could run these scripts? What if these scripts measured more forms of censorship, beyond Tor blocking? And what if the results of these scripts could be published as open data so that everyone around the world could learn about (and respond to) internet censorship?</p><p>Ultimately, these ideas gave birth to the vision for OONI: creating an open framework with open methodologies for measuring internet censorship globally based on open data. This idea was a shift from how internet censorship research was being carried out at the time – most of which was based on closed source software and without openly available data, limiting the possibility for independent, third-party verification of the findings. OONI paved the way for an open approach to censorship research and to this day, remains one of the few projects that measure internet censorship globally based on <a href=https://ooni.org/install/>free software tools</a> and <a href=https://ooni.org/data/>open data</a>.</p><p>OONI’s <a href=https://ooni.org/post/highlights-10-years-of-ooni/>growth and success over the past decade</a> wouldn’t have been possible without the <a href=https://www.torproject.org/>Tor Project</a>, who supported us every step of the way. We eventually reached a point where OONI had evolved into a project with global reach and impact, with its own distinct community, raising the need to transition from a project to a non-profit organization. We were not ready to do that immediately (due to limited team capacity), so we sought temporary fiscal sponsorship from the <a href=https://www.hermescenter.org/>Hermes Center for Transparency and Digital Human Rights</a> in 2020, while operating independently in terms of fundraising and governance. </p><p>This year, we finally made the Big Step and established a legal entity for OONI, officially becoming a non-profit organization registered in Italy. We chose Rome because some of our team members in leadership positions are based there and it made sense from a bureaucratic perspective.</p><p>If you’re interested in supporting OONI in this moment of growth, please <a href=https://ooni.org/donate/>consider making a donation</a>. You can also <a href=https://shop.ooni.org/>purchase OONI swag</a> (such as t-shirts, mugs, water bottles, stickers, and tote bags) in support of OONI’s work, or become an <a href=https://ooni.org/about/supporters>OONI supporter</a>.</p><h2 id=new-ooni-project-manager>New OONI Project Manager</h2><p>As part of OONI’s growth, we hired a dedicated OONI Project Manager to help manage our software development work. In May 2023, we published a <a href=https://ooni.org/post/2023-job-opening-ooni-project-manager/>job opening</a> and we had the opportunity to meet and interview multiple strong candidates for the position.</p><p>In August 2023, we were thrilled to welcome <strong>Jessie Bonisteel</strong> as our new Project Manager!</p><p>Jessie joined us with a wealth of both engineering management and project management expertise, having previously worked with organizations that include <a href=https://tails.net/>Tails</a> and <a href=https://www.mozilla.org/>Mozilla</a>. As part of her role as OONI’s Project Manager, Jessie manages our software development team, ensuring that our projects are on track and supporting a global community that relies on our tools for measuring internet censorship.</p><h2 id=new-ooni-measurement-tools>New OONI measurement tools</h2><h3 id=launched-ooni-probe-web>Launched OONI Probe Web</h3><div><a href=/post/2023-year-in-review/images/image3.png><img src=/post/2023-year-in-review/images/image3_hu680262826111713594.png title="OONI Explorer" alt="OONI Explorer"></a></div><p><strong>Image:</strong> <a href=https://probe-web.ooni.org/>OONI Probe Web</a>.</p><p>In March 2023, we <a href=https://ooni.org/post/introducing-ooni-probe-web/>launched</a> <a href=https://ooni.org/post/introducing-ooni-probe-web/>OONI Probe Web</a>: a new browser-based tool for measuring the blocking of websites.</p><p>We built <a href=https://probe-web.ooni.org/>OONI Probe Web</a> in response to long-term community feedback, requesting a censorship measurement tool that can be run from a browser, without requiring the installation of any software. Our goal is to support rapid response efforts to emergent censorship events.</p><p>OONI Probe Web <a href=https://ooni.org/post/introducing-ooni-probe-web/>advances the state of the art of browser-based measurements</a>, and we’re excited to improve upon it over the next few years. But due to <a href=https://ooni.org/post/introducing-ooni-probe-web/#limitations>limitations</a> in the API available to web browsers, it’s not possible to run advanced experiments (like the OONI Probe <a href=https://ooni.org/nettest/web-connectivity/>Web Connectivity experiment</a>). Therefore, <a href=https://probe-web.ooni.org/>OONI Probe Web</a> should not serve as a replacement for the <a href=https://ooni.org/install/>OONI Probe apps</a>, but as a complementary tool.</p><h3 id=launched-news-media-scan-app-with-deutsche-welle-dw>Launched News Media Scan app with Deutsche Welle (DW)</h3><div><a href=/post/2023-year-in-review/images/image9.png><img src=/post/2023-year-in-review/images/image9_hu15610925180510058114.png title="OONI Explorer" alt="OONI Explorer"></a></div><p><strong>Image:</strong> <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dw.ooniprobe">News Media Scan app by DW</a>.</p><p>In October 2023, <a href=https://www.dw.com/>Deutsche Welle (DW)</a> and OONI <a href=https://corporate.dw.com/en/news-media-scan-by-dw-deutsche-welle-and-ooni-launch-new-app/a-66996347>launched</a> the Android <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dw.ooniprobe">News Media Scan app</a> for measuring news media censorship.</p><p>In collaboration with DW, we developed an OONI Probe-based app (“News Media Scan”) designed to measure the blocking of <a href=https://github.com/citizenlab/test-lists/tree/master/lists>news media websites</a>. Similarly to OONI Probe, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dw.ooniprobe">News Media Scan app</a> test results are published by OONI as <a href=https://ooni.org/data/>open data</a> in real-time.</p><p>We are excited about this new app, as we expect that it will help boost news media censorship measurement worldwide, supporting efforts to defend press freedom around the world.</p><h3 id=building-ooni-run-v2>Building OONI Run v2</h3><div><a href=/post/2023-year-in-review/images/image11.png><img src=/post/2023-year-in-review/images/image11_hu16953336475157350765.png title="OONI Explorer" alt="OONI Explorer"></a></div><p><strong>Image:</strong> <a href=https://run.ooni.io/>OONI Run</a>.</p><p>This year, <a href=https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/blog/crowdsourcing-data-as-a-tool-to-fight-internet-censorship/>OONI became a Mozilla awardee</a> and a member of the <a href=https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/data-futures-lab/>2023 Mozilla Data Futures Lab cohort</a>: five projects creating crowdsourced datasets for the public good. As part of this, we have been working on creating a <strong>new and improved version</strong> of <a href=https://run.ooni.io/>OONI Run</a> (“OONI Run v2”), addressing key <a href=https://ooni.org/post/2020-06-09-ooni-run-usability-study-findings/>community feedback and needs</a>.</p><p><a href=https://run.ooni.io/>OONI Run</a> is a web platform that you can use to generate mobile deep links and widget code to coordinate the <a href=https://ooni.org/install/mobile>OONI Probe</a> testing of websites. You can share these links with a community of volunteers (who are <a href=https://ooni.org/install/mobile>OONI Probe mobile app</a> users) so that they can test the websites of your choice, contributing measurements that are published as <a href=https://ooni.org/data/>open data</a> in real-time.</p><p><a href=https://run.ooni.io/>OONI Run</a> therefore enables decentralized, community-driven efforts aimed at coordinating the testing of website blocking. The goal of this platform is to enable community members to independently coordinate on the testing of websites, particularly when new blocks emerge. All test results are published as <a href=https://ooni.org/data/>open data</a> in real-time, supporting <a href=https://ooni.org/reports/>research</a> and <a href=https://www.accessnow.org/keepiton/>advocacy</a> efforts.</p><p>Community members often run such campaigns <a href=https://sinarproject.org/digital-rights/measuring-and-detecting-network-interference/ge15>leading up to and during an election</a>, or in response to emergent new blocks during protests or other political events. Sometimes, researchers coordinate with communities of <a href=https://ooni.org/install/mobile>OONI Probe</a> volunteers for the testing of their custom lists of websites.</p><p>For example, <a href=https://sinarproject.org/>Sinar Project</a> used OONI Run to coordinate an <a href=https://sinarproject.org/digital-rights/measuring-and-detecting-network-interference/ge15>OONI censorship measurement campaign in Malaysia</a> to encourage the testing of election-related websites during the country’s 2022 general election. India’s <a href=https://sflc.in/>Software Freedom Law Centre (SFLC.in)</a> embedded OONI Run widgets into their <a href=https://internetshutdowns.in/>India Internet Shutdown Tracker project</a> website, encouraging long-term OONI Probe testing of news media, blogs, human rights, and political websites in India. <a href=https://veinteligente.org/>Venezuela Inteligente</a> coordinated with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDvVfjJ0Iq8">OONI Probe volunteers in different regions of Venezuela</a> to measure (and respond to) <a href=https://vesinfiltro.com/>temporary website blocks</a> which emerged in correlation with political events.</p><p>To improve the OONI Run platform and better meet community needs, we previously conducted an <a href=https://ooni.org/post/2020-06-09-ooni-run-usability-study-findings/>OONI Run usability study</a>, through which we documented extensive community feedback. In 2023, we made significant progress towards addressing the key community feedback and needs identified through our usability study to better support censorship rapid response efforts worldwide.</p><p>We aim to launch OONI Run v2 in 2024. Stay tuned!</p><h2 id=new-ooni-explorer-features>New OONI Explorer features</h2><p>Arguably, some of the biggest OONI highlights from 2023 are the new <a href=https://explorer.ooni.org/>OONI Explorer</a> features!</p><p><a href=https://explorer.ooni.org/>OONI Explorer</a> is the world’s largest <strong>open dataset on internet censorship</strong>.</p><p>This data is contributed by <a href=https://ooni.org/install/>OONI Probe</a> users worldwide, who run censorship measurement tests on their local networks, contributing test results as open data in real-time.

This will enable the internet freedom community to more effectively coordinate censorship measurement campaigns and use OONI data in support of their research and advocacy efforts.</li><li><strong>Methodology for measuring throttling.</strong> Throughout 2023, we advanced our methods for measuring cases of throttling by <a href=https://ooni.org/post/2023-throttling-kz-elections/#methodology>analyzing the TLS handshake timing information</a> and the <a href=https://github.com/ooni/probe/issues/2493>HTTP body download speed</a> of <a href=https://ooni.org/nettest/web-connectivity/>Web Connectivity</a> measurements. We aim to expand our methods for measuring throttling in 2024.</li><li><strong>Expanding OONI’s testing model to support richer testing input.</strong> Throughout 2023, we worked on expanding OONI&rsquo;s testing model to support richer testing input, enabling more dynamic and extensive censorship testing. We released two versions of a <a href=https://github.com/ooni/2023-05-richer-input>richer testing input prototype</a>, and we experimented with a <a href=https://github.com/ooni/2023-05-richer-input/releases/tag/v0.3.0>DSL</a> which is a fundamental building block to enable the roll-out of new experiments without new OONI Probe releases. We aim to start rolling out simple richer input, where we pass extra configuration parameters to experiments, in 2024. We also aim to continue research on using a DSL to define experiments.</li><li><strong>Automating censorship detection and characterization based on OONI measurements.</strong> Throughout 2023, we made significant improvements to our <a href=https://github.com/ooni/data>data analysis tool</a> for the automatic detection and characterization of internet censorship. In practice, this tool was used to support many of our <a href=https://ooni.org/reports/>research reports</a> and rapid response efforts, and we trained third-party researchers on how to use it for their own research. We aim to work towards shipping this tool in production in 2024.</li><li><strong>New Social Media Censorship Alert System.</strong> Throughout 2023, we worked on building a <a href=https://github.com/ooni/backend/pull/651>Social Media Censorship Alert System</a> with real-time notifications and summaries of blocking alerts based on OONI data. In 2024, we aim to work towards shipping this in production.</li><li><strong>Thematic presentation of censorship findings on OONI Explorer.</strong> In 2024, we aim to work towards creating new pages on <a href=https://explorer.ooni.org/>OONI Explorer</a> which present thematic censorship findings from around the world (such as findings on the blocking of news media and human rights websites based on OONI data). This will enable the internet freedom community to more easily discover and respond to new censorship events affecting platforms of public interest (such as news media), without having to dig through OONI measurements.</li><li><strong>Research reports on internet censorship around the world.</strong> We aim to publish many more <a href=https://ooni.org/reports/>research reports</a> in collaboration with our <a href=https://ooni.org/partners>partners</a>. We also aim to publish timely reports on emergent censorship events on the OONI <a href=https://explorer.ooni.org/findings>Censorship Findings</a> page.</li><li><strong>Strengthening partnerships and support towards the global OONI community.</strong> To expand and diversify global OONI censorship measurement coverage, we aim to expand and strengthen our <a href=https://ooni.org/partners>partnerships</a>. We also aim to improve our community resources and facilitate OONI workshops to help expand the use of <a href=https://ooni.org/data/>OONI data</a> by the internet freedom community.</li></ul><p>Our above priorities for 2024 have been informed by community feedback collected over the years (as well as in response to the dynamic censorship environment worldwide).
