<span class=date>2022-12-23</span></div><p>Hong Kong, a place geographically conjunct to the soil of Mainland China, has been previously known as a free society, endured and still enduring multiple historical occasions. Once, there was no nationwide internet censorship until the latest development that local authorities and Beijing forcefully implemented the Hong Kong national security law in late June 2020. Currently, at least four websites are known to be censored, and a few ongoing discussions among pro-Beijing parties and the government to put censorship up on instant messaging and social platforms.</p><p>In this country report, we focus on depicting the current and new censorship events post-establishment of the Hong Kong National Security Law between January 1 to June 30, 2022, based on OONI network measurement data.</p><hr><ul><li>In 2019 and early 2020, citizens of Hong Kong demonstrated widespread Anti-ELAB (Anti Extradition Law Amendment Bill) protests in response to the amendment bill on extradition conditions for fugitive offenders proposed by the Hong Kong government.</li><li>On June 30, 2020, the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress unanimously decided to enact and implement the Hong Kong National Security Law.</li><li>In January 2021, a local ISP “Hong Kong Broadband Network”, responded to media inquiries, affirming their execution of censorship was responding to the request from the Hong Kong Police Force on the grounds of National Security.</li><li>Since the enactment of the Hong Kong national security law, up until now, at least four political and dissident-related websites have been nationally blocked on national security grounds.

Freedom of speech, civil society, and pro-democratic press and publication also suffered from high-pressure crackdowns from local authorities, as reported in the 135th session of the UN Human Rights committee.</p><p>The Open Observatory of Network Interference (OONI), Sinar Project, and a group of independent Hong Kong researchers collaborated on a joint study. Throughout this report, the team examines whether internet censorship events persist in the country through the collection and analysis of network measurements.</p><p>This study aims to increase the transparency of internet controls in Hong Kong. This report will provide information about the network landscape and internet penetration levels of Hong Kong, its legal environment concerning freedom of expression, access to information, and privacy, as well as cases of censorship in the country. The remaining parts of the report document this study’s methodology and key findings.</p><p>Selected scope of ISPs in this report:</p><ul><li>AS4515 & AS4760 & AS38819 - PCCW HKT</li><li>AS9231 & AS131872 - China Mobile Hong Kong</li><li>AS9269 & AS9381 & AS10103 - Hong Kong Broadband Network</li><li>AS9304 & AS10118 - Hutchison Global Communications (Hong Kong)</li><li>AS9908 - HK Cable TV</li><li>AS17924 - SmarTone Mobile Communications</li></ul><h2 id=background>Background</h2><p>Hong Kong is a special administrative region of China<sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup>, an ex-colony of the United Kingdom, and was previously known as one of the most popular free ports and major trade centres in Asia. This land has a population of roughly 7.2 million<sup id=fnref:2><a href=#fn:2 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>2</a></sup> with a total of 100% urban population<sup id=fnref:3><a href=#fn:3 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>3</a></sup>, inclusively spanning across multi-ethnicity and different religions<sup id=fnref:3><a href=#fn:3 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>3</a></sup> as well.</p><p>Historically, Great Britain signed the “Sino-British Joint Declaration” with the People’s Republic of China to resolve the “Agreement on the future of Hong Kong” for both countries. China regained sovereignty to the ex-colony in July 1997 and “preserves Hong Kong’s familiar legal system and the rights and freedoms enjoyed there.” <sup id=fnref:4><a href=#fn:4 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>4</a></sup> Different from China, Hong Kong looks up to the principle of “One Country, Two Systems” <sup id=fnref:5><a href=#fn:5 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>5</a></sup>, the very foundation laid in the organic law “Hong Kong Basic Law” <sup id=fnref:6><a href=#fn:6 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>6</a></sup>.</p><p>Politically, Hong Kong has been governed by a hybrid regime<sup id=fnref:7><a href=#fn:7 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>7</a></sup> since July 1997. The Chief Executive is the head of government<sup id=fnref:8><a href=#fn:8 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>8</a></sup>. The Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress is in charge of appointing the elected Chief Executive<sup id=fnref:8><a href=#fn:8 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>8</a></sup>. Chief Executive candidates are vetted and only approved by the Committee for Safeguarding National Security without a straightforward appealing mechanism<sup id=fnref:9><a href=#fn:9 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>9</a></sup>.</p><p>In 2019 and early 2020, citizens of Hong Kong demonstrated widespread Anti-ELAB(Anti Extradition Law Amendment Bill) protests in responding to the amendment bill on extradition conditions for fugitive offenders proposed by the Hong Kong government. On June 30, 2020, the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress unanimously decided<sup id=fnref:10><a href=#fn:10 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>10</a></sup><sup id=fnref:11><a href=#fn:11 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>11</a></sup> to enact and implement the Hong Kong National Security Law, a countermeasure to the mass protest on the street and establishing the legislative power for local authorities to censorships based on national security grounds.</p><h3 id=legal-environment><strong>Legal environment</strong></h3><h4 id=hong-kong-basic-law>Hong Kong Basic Law</h4><p>The Hong Kong Basic Law, which served as organic law, and is also seen as a constitutional document<sup id=fnref:6><a href=#fn:6 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>6</a></sup> by the Hong Kong government, has guaranteed that all residents of Hong Kong are equal before the law and possess inviolable rights to “freedom of speech, of the press and of publication; freedom of association, of assembly, of procession and of demonstration; and the right and freedom to form and join trade unions, and to strike.” <sup id=fnref:12><a href=#fn:12 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>12</a></sup></p><h4 id=legislative-context>Legislative context</h4><p>There are three major criminal laws currently ruling computer crimes in Hong Kong:</p><ul><li>Cap. 106 Telecommunications Ordinance<ul><li>Section 27A Unauthorized access to computer by telecommunications</li></ul></li><li>Cap. 200 Crimes Ordinance<ul><li>Section 60 Destroying or damaging property</li><li>Section 161 Access to computer with criminal or dishonest intent</li></ul></li></ul><p>Over the past ten years, some computer crime cases have been dismissed differently because of frail to no evidence of the defendant purposefully stealing or without authorization to gain information from online information systems.</p><p>For instance, on July 3, 2019, a flight passenger Chan was released from court with a bind-over condition<sup id=fnref:13><a href=#fn:13 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>13</a></sup>, only that he found out the electronic boarding pass website leaked information to other users by changing a few characters in the web address field. In this court case, Chan stated he had immediately notified the airline company and the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data right after discovering the vulnerability. However, there were no replies from both parties after three weeks. Instead, Chan was then arrested and prosecuted for “unauthorized access to computer by telecommunications” by the authorities, accusing Chan of having accessed the personal information of other passengers.</p><p>A side note to better illustrates the legislative landscape would be the recent judicial review filed by Hong Kong citizen Cheuk-Kin Kwok. The applicant hopes to stop the government from nullifying vaccination exemption letters through a declaration in the Gazette. However, soon after the court ruling in favour of Kwok, Chief Execute John Lee Ka-Chiu amended the law, empowering concrete legal rights to the health secretary in nullifying exemption letters upon “reasonable grounds”.</p><p>Also, given that the current ruling party in Hong Kong took sides with Beijing, this curated great convenience for the government and pro-Beijing parties on policy-making and legislative changes. For example, on October 21, 2022, the Hong Kong government published in the Gazette an amendment bill proposal to the Cap. 138A “Pharmacy and Poisons Regulations” to further restrict antipyretic drug sales<sup id=fnref:14><a href=#fn:14 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>14</a></sup>. Without any opposition from the Legislative Council, drugs like aspirin and paracetamol will be added to the “Schedule 1” list of poisons in a year. General citizens then can only purchase simplex painkillers like Tylenol and Panadol (common brand names for paracetamol) from registered pharmacies, dispensaries, government-sanctioned “listed sellers of poisons”, or clinics. On the complementary side, Cap. 134 “Dangerous Drugs Ordinance” rules that nobody can possess poison listed in “Schedule 1” or be fined or imprisoned for up to 7 years.</p><h4 id=hong-kong-national-security-law--legislative-reform>Hong Kong National Security Law & Legislative Reform</h4><p>Currently, there are a total of 66 articles inside the Hong Kong National Security Law in effect, with a prominent count of 3 articles affecting the global population:</p><ul><li><strong>Article 38</strong>: This Law shall apply to offences under this Law committed against the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region from outside the Region by a person who is not a permanent resident of the Region.</li><li><strong>Article 43</strong>: &mldr; the department for safeguarding national security of the Police Force of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region may &mldr; <strong>requiring a person, who is suspected, on reasonable grounds, of having in possession information or material relevant to investigation, to answer questions and furnish such information or produce such material</strong> &mldr;</li><li><strong>Article 47</strong>: The courts of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region shall obtain a certificate from the Chief Executive to certify whether an act involves national security or whether the relevant evidence involves State secrets when such questions arise in the adjudication of a case. The certificate shall be binding on the courts.</li></ul><p>As of writing, no court judgements or valuable legislative perspectives give valid explanations and justification for cyber crimes charges using the Hong Kong National Security Law.</p><p>The Law Reform Commission of Hong Kong has gathered a cybercrime-specific legislative reforming committee<sup id=fnref:15><a href=#fn:15 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>15</a></sup>. On July 2022, the sub-committee published a consultation paper<sup id=fnref:16><a href=#fn:16 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>16</a></sup>. Inside, it proposes five cybercrime categories: “illegal access to program or data”, “illegal interception of computer data”, “illegal interference of computer data”, “illegal interference of computer system”, and “making available or possessing a device or data for committing a crime” in the documents from the committee.</p><h3 id=reported-cases-of-internet-censorship><strong>Reported cases of internet censorship</strong></h3><h4 id=isp-officially-confirms-national-censorship>ISP officially confirms national censorship</h4><p>The first censorship happened in January 2021<sup id=fnref:17><a href=#fn:17 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>17</a></sup> <sup id=fnref:18><a href=#fn:18 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>18</a></sup> <sup id=fnref:19><a href=#fn:19 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>19</a></sup>. The website “HKChronicles” displays doxxed personal information of police officers, pro-Beijing members of the Legislative Council, and a revelation of graphics and videos depicting police brutalities since the 2019 Anti-ELAB(Anti Extradition Law Amendment Bill) social movement.</p><p>Later that month, a local major Internet Service Provider(ISP), “Hong Kong Broadband Network”, responded to media inquiries<sup id=fnref:20><a href=#fn:20 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>20</a></sup> <sup id=fnref:21><a href=#fn:21 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>21</a></sup>, affirming their execution of censorship was responding to the request from the Hong Kong Police Force on the grounds of National Security. It is the first time a local ISP has come out and revealed that authorities have been exercising administrative power granted by the Hong Kong National Security Law to perform censorship nationwide. Other local ISPs have not responded to media inquiries directly, only stating that the company will follow local regulations<sup id=fnref:22><a href=#fn:22 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>22</a></sup>.</p><h2 id=examining-internet-censorship-in-hong-kong>Examining internet censorship in Hong Kong</h2><p>A group of independent Hong Kong researchers, in collaboration with the Sinar Project and with assistance from the Open Observatory of Network Interference (OONI), performed a study on internet censorship in Hong Kong.

DNS
- dns.confirmed - one of the returned IPs matches an IP known to be used to implement blocking
- dns.no_ipv4 - no IPv4 address was returned
- dns.bogon - a bogon IP address was returned
- dns.nxdomain - we got an NXDOMAIN response from the probe, but we got a valid response from the control vantage point
- dns.inconsistent - our DNS consistency heuristics determined the returned IP to be inconsistent
- dns.user_ip - The particular measurement included the IP address of the probe in the DNS query response and since OONI scrubs sensitive data from measurements the IP was replaced with [scrubbed].

HTTP
These are all blocking types related to plaintext HTTP requests:
- http.confirmed - the returned page is a known blockpage
- http.http_diff - the page doesn't match based on our page consistency heuristics
- http.connection_reset - we got a connection reset to a plaintext HTTP request
- http.connection_closed - the connection was closed before all data was transmitted
- http.connection_timeout - the connection timed out before we could retrieve all the data
- http.generic_failure - this is a generic error from legacy OONI probes

TLS
These are all blocking types related to TLS:
- tls.connection_reset - a reset packet was seen after the client sent the ClientHello packet
- tls.connection_closed - the connection was closed after the ClientHello
- tls.connection_timeout - the connection timed out after the ClientHello

All of the above can also have the _after_hello suffix, indicating that the event happened after the client sent the ClientHello packet
- tls.mitm - The DNS is consistent, but the TLS certificate validation failed. This suggest a TLS man-in-the-middle
- tls.generic_failure - generic error from legacy OONI probes

To this end, OONI software tests were run across different local vantage points in Hong Kong to collect and analyse network measurement data that could help examine whether sites, instant messaging apps, and censorship circumvention tools were blocked. Some of the tests also run were designed to examine whether systems (“middleboxes”) that could be responsible for censorship, surveillance, and traffic manipulation were present in the tested networks. Overall, the accessibility of 2228 domains was tested, and the network measurement data collected between January 1, 2022, to June 30 2022, was analysed.</p><p>The key findings of this study show that local ISPs in Hong Kong appear to primarily be implementing censorship through DNS hijacking and DNS-based censorship (in the case of blocking the four censored websites, for example).</p><p>As part of this study, four websites with multiple of their aliases domain names were confirmed to be blocked across 6 ISPs (PCCW HKT, China Mobile Hong Kong, Hong Kong Broadband Network, Hutchison Global Communications (Hong Kong), HK Cable TV, and SmarTone Mobile Communications) and their downstream providers as well. It is worth highlighting that PCCW HKT leaves its commercial and public sector networks to remain uncensored; only the residential lines are affected. On the positive side, WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, Telegram, Signal, Psiphon and the Tor network (vanilla) appeared to remain accessible across most ISPs presented in the OONI measurement test results.</p><p>Given the limited transparency around information controls in Hong Kong and the potential implications they may have on human rights, we encourage ISPs to disclose their motivation and justification behind blocking sites and services. We also encourage public debate based on the findings of this study around the necessity and proportionality of information controls.</p><h3 id=contribute-to-the-study><strong>Contribute to the study</strong></h3><p>There are various ways one may contribute to the OONI measurements:</p><ul><li>Testing: You may test on <a href=https://ooni.org/install/>various platforms</a>, both on Mobile (iOS and Android) and Desktop, including on the CLI on Linux platforms.

A domain is a name that is commonly attributed to websites (when they’re created), so that they can be more easily accessed and remembered. For example, twitter.com is the domain of the Twitter website. However, computers can’t connect to internet services through domain names, but based on IP addresses: the digital address of each service on the internet. Similarly, in the physical world, you would need the address of a house (rather than the name of the house itself) in order to visit it. The Domain Name System (DNS) is what is responsible for transforming a human- readable domain name (such as ooni.org) into its numerical IP address counterpart (in this case:104.198.14.52), thus allowing your computer to access the intended website.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>HTTP</strong></td><td>The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is the underlying protocol used by the World Wide Web to transfer or exchange data across the internet. The HTTP protocol allows communication between a client and a server. It does so by handling a client’s request to connect to a server, and the server’s response to the client’s request. All websites include an HTTP (or HTTPS) prefix (such as <a href=http://example.com/>http://example.com/</a>) so that your computer (the client) can request and receive the content of a website (hosted on a server). All websites include an HTTP (or HTTPS) prefix (such as <a href=http://example.com/>http://example.com/</a>) so that your computer (the client) can request and receive the content of a website (hosted on a server). The transmission of data over the HTTP protocol is unencrypted.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>ISP</strong></td><td>An Internet Service Provider (ISP) is an organization that provides services for accessing and using the internet. ISPs can be state-owned, commercial, community-owned, non-profit, or otherwise privately owned. Vodafone, AT&T, Airtel, and MTN are examples of ISPs.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Middle boxes</strong></td><td>A middlebox is a computer networking device that transforms, inspects, filters, or otherwise manipulates traffic for purposes other than packet forwarding. Many Internet Service Providers (ISPs) around the world use middleboxes to improve network performance, provide users with faster access to websites, and for a number of other networking purposes. Sometimes though, middleboxes are also used to implement internet censorship and/or surveillance. The OONI Probe app includes two tests designed to measure networks with the aim of identifying the presence of middleboxes.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>TCP</strong></td><td>The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is one of the main protocols on the internet. To connect to a website, your computer needs to establish a TCP connection to the address of that website. TCP works on top of the Internet Protocol (IP), which defines how to address computers on the internet. When speaking to a machine over the TCP protocol you use an IP and port pair, which looks something like this: 10.20.1.1:8080. The main difference between TCP and (another very popular protocol called) UDP is that TCP has the notion of a “connection”, making it a “reliable” transport protocol.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>TLS</strong></td><td>Transport Layer Security (TLS) – also referred to as “SSL” – is a cryptographic protocol that allows you to maintain a secure, encrypted connection between your computer and an internet service. When you connect to a website through TLS, the address of the website will begin with HTTPS (such as <a href=https://www.facebook.com/),>https://www.facebook.com/),</a> instead of HTTP.</td></tr><tr><td>A comprehensive glossary related to OONI can be accessed here: <a href=https://ooni.org/support/glossary/>https://ooni.org/support/glossary/</a>.</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id=annex-ii-methodology>Annex II: Methodology</h2><h3 id=data><strong>Data</strong></h3><p>Data computed based on the heuristics for this report can be downloaded here: <a href=https://github.com/Sinar/imap-data>https://github.com/Sinar/imap-data</a> whereas aggregated data can be downloaded from <a href=https://explorer.ooni.org/>OONI Explorer</a>.</p><h3 id=coverage><strong>Coverage</strong></h3><p>The iMAP State of Internet Censorship Country Report covers the findings of network measurement collected through Open Observatory of Network Interference (OONI) <a href=https://ooni.org/install/>OONI Probe App</a> that measures the blocking of websites, instant messaging apps, circumvention tools and network tampering.

OONI takes measures to remove them from the collected measurements, to protect its users from <a href=https://ooni.org/about/risks/>potential risks</a>. However, there may be instances where users’ IP addresses and other potentially personally-identifiable information are unintentionally collected, if such information is included in the HTTP headers or other metadata of measurements. For example, this can occur if the tested websites include tracking technologies or custom content based on a user’s network location.</p><h4 id=network-measurements>Network measurements</h4><p>The types of network measurements that OONI collects depend on the types of tests that are run. Specifications about each OONI test can be viewed through its <a href=https://github.com/ooni/spec>git repository</a>, and details about what collected network measurements entail can be viewed through <a href=https://explorer.ooni.org/world/>OONI Explorer</a> or through <a href=https://api.ooni.io/>OONI’s measurement API</a>.</p><p>In order to derive meaning from the measurements collected, OONI processes the data types mentioned above to answer the following questions:</p><ul><li>Which types of OONI tests were run?</li><li>In which countries were those tests run?</li><li>In which networks were those tests run?</li><li>When were tests run?</li><li>What types of network interference occurred?</li><li>In which countries did network interference occur?</li><li>In which networks did network interference occur?</li><li>When did network interference occur?</li><li>How did network interference occur?</li></ul><p>To answer such questions, OONI’s pipeline is designed to answer such questions by processing network measurements data to enable the following:</p><ul><li>Attributing measurements to a specific country.</li><li>Attributing measurements to a specific network within a country.</li><li>Distinguishing measurements based on the specific tests that were run for their collection.</li><li>Distinguishing between “normal” and “anomalous” measurements (the latter indicating that a form of network tampering is likely present).</li><li>Identifying the type of network interference based on a set of heuristics for DNS tampering, TCP/IP blocking, and HTTP blocking.</li><li>Identifying block pages based on a set of heuristics for HTTP blocking.</li><li>Identifying the presence of “middle boxes” within tested networks.</li></ul><p>According to OONI, false positives may occur within the processed data due to a number of reasons. DNS resolvers (operated by Google or a local ISP) often provide users with IP addresses that are closest to them geographically. While this may appear to be a case of DNS tampering, it is actually done with the intention of providing users with faster access to websites. Similarly, false positives may emerge when tested websites serve different content depending on the country that the user is connecting from, or in the cases when websites return failures even though they are not tampered with.</p><p>Furthermore, measurements indicating HTTP or TCP/IP blocking might actually be due to temporary HTTP or TCP/IP failures, and may not conclusively be a sign of network interference. It is therefore important to test the same sets of websites across time and to cross-correlate data, prior to reaching a conclusion on whether websites are in fact being blocked.</p><p>Since block pages differ from country to country and sometimes even from network to network, it is quite challenging to accurately identify them. OONI uses a series of heuristics to try to guess if the page in question differs from the expected control, but these heuristics can often result in false positives. For this reason OONI only says that there is a confirmed instance of blocking when a block page is detected.</p><p>Upon collection of more network measurements, OONI continues to develop its data analysis heuristics, based on which it attempts to accurately identify censorship events.</p><p>The full list of country-specific test lists containing confirmed blocked websites in Myanmar, Cambodia, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam can be viewed here: <a href=https://github.com/citizenlab/test-lists>https://github.com/citizenlab/test-lists</a>.</p><h4 id=confirmed-vs-heuristics>Confirmed vs Heuristics</h4><p>Confirmed OONI measurements were based on blockpages with fingerprints recorded here <a href=https://github.com/ooni/blocking-fingerprints>https://github.com/ooni/blocking-fingerprints</a>.</p><p>Hence, heuristics as below were run on raw measurements on all countries under iMAP to further confirm blockings.</p><p>Firstly, IP addresses with more than 10 domains were identified. Then each of the IP address was checked for the following:</p><p><img src=images/image7.png alt></p><p>When blocking is determined, any domain redirected to these IP addresses would be marked as ‘dns.confirmed’.</p><p>Secondly, HTTP titles and bodies were analysed to determine blockpages. This <a href="https://explorer.ooni.org/measurement/20220411T125618Z_webconnectivity_IN_58678_n1_6zLG8ySiJHIq07Un?input=http%3A%2F%2Finfluence.in%2F">example</a> shows that the HTTP returns the text <em>‘The URL has been blocked as per the instructions of the DoT in compliance to the orders of Court of Law’</em>. Any domain redirected to these HTTP titles and bodies would be marked as ‘http.confirmed’.</p><p>As a result, false positives are eliminated and more confirmed blockings were obtained including countries like Cambodia, Vietnam and Philippines which have no confirmed blocking fingerprints on OONI.</p><p>In the case of Hong Kong, the results of the heuristics showed external censorship from outside of the country instead of local censorship. Thus, the local researchers had analysed the OONI measurements manually to identify confirmed blockings. The domains identified were based on the timed-out instances.</p><h2 id=about-imap>About iMAP</h2><p>Internet Monitoring Action Project (iMAP) aims to establish regional and in-country networks that monitor network interference and restrictions to the freedom of expression online in 9 countries: Myanmar, Cambodia, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam. Sinar Project is currently working with national digital rights partners in these 9 countries. The project is done via Open Observatory Network Interference (OONI) detection and reporting systems, involving the maintenance of test lists and measurements.</p><p>More information available at: <a href=http://imap.sinarproject.org>imap.sinarproject.org</a>.
