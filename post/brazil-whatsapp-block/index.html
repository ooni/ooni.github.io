encryption</a> to protect the privacy and
security of its 1 billion users worldwide, several cases of censorship have
been ordered by governments who are frustrated with the fact that they can no
longer access users' private communications. Having implemented end-to-end
encryption with the Signal protocol, WhatsApp cannot decrypt its users' data,
even if it wanted to - which is precisely what makes it secure.</p><p>Last December, a judge in Brazil backfired to WhatsApp&rsquo;s non-compliance in a
criminal investigation by [ordering the blocking of WhatsApp for 48 hours]
(<a href=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/dec/17/whatsapp-blocked-brazil-48-hours-facebook)>https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/dec/17/whatsapp-blocked-brazil-48-hours-facebook)</a>.
Similarly, early this week another Brazilian judge
[ordered the blocking of WhatsApp]
(<a href=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/may/02/brazil-whatsapp-block-72-hours>https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/may/02/brazil-whatsapp-block-72-hours</a>)
but this time, for 72 hours - as a form of retribution for the company&rsquo;s
failure to hand over data as part of an ongoing drug trafficking
investigation. Both orders for censorship were lifted in less than 24 hours
following a public uproar, since [more than 100 million individuals]
(<a href=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/technology/tech-news/whatsapp-comes-down-how-brazilians-are-coping-without-their-social-mediafixes/article27799710/>http://www.theglobeandmail.com/technology/tech-news/whatsapp-comes-down-how-brazilians-are-coping-without-their-social-mediafixes/article27799710/</a>)
in Brazil (91% of mobile users) depend on WhatsApp for their daily
communications.</p><p>According to Lucas Teixeira, Chief Technologist at [Coding Rights]
(<a href=https://www.codingrights.org/):>https://www.codingrights.org/):</a></p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;People reacted to the blocking of WhatsApp with a mix of shock, revolt and
mockery, reflecting the fact that Whatsapp is used by pretty much everyone
in big and small cities - and even in the countryside - to communicate with
each other, replacing SMS and phone calls almost 100%. The company&rsquo;s
zero-rating partnerships with telcos has also helped a lot. Mobile Internet
plans with data caps but &ldquo;free Whatsapp&rdquo; are common. Marco Civil da
Internet explicitly forbids violations to net neutrality, but the legality
or not of zero rating will be set in its ongoing regulation process. As for
the legality of WhatsApp&rsquo;s blocking, we can&rsquo;t be sure because the
litigation is secret, but it has been reversed in court.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>Following the latest reports of WhatsApp being blocked in Brazil, the
<a href=https://ooni.org/>Open Observatory of Network Interference (OONI)</a>
ran tests locally in Brazil to detect the technical details of how censorship
was implemented. This blog post includes a publication of our measurements,
revealing that Brazilian ISPs blocked WhatsApp&rsquo;s website through DNS hijacking.</p><h1 id=our-findings>Our findings</h1><p>Two types of <a href=https://github.com/TheTorProject/ooni-spec>OONI tests</a> were run
in Brazil to identify whether and how WhatsApp was blocked:</p><ul><li>[DNS-consistency tests]
(<a href=https://github.com/TheTorProject/ooni-probe/blob/master/docs/source/tests/dnsconsistency.rst>https://github.com/TheTorProject/ooni-probe/blob/master/docs/source/tests/dnsconsistency.rst</a>)</li><li>[HTTP-request tests]
(<a href=https://github.com/TheTorProject/ooni-probe/blob/master/docs/source/tests/http_requests.rst>https://github.com/TheTorProject/ooni-probe/blob/master/docs/source/tests/http_requests.rst</a>)</li></ul><p>The first test is designed to compare the DNS query results from a DNS resolver
which is considered to be reliable with one that it tested for tampering. The
second test tries to detect online censorship based on a comparison of HTTP
requests over <a href=https://www.torproject.org/>Tor</a> and over the network of the
user. By running these two types of tests on <strong>web.whatsapp.com</strong> and
<strong><a href=http://www.whatsapp.com>www.whatsapp.com</a></strong>, <strong>DNS hijacking</strong> was identified as a method for blocking
WhatsApp, as illustrated below:</p><p><strong>DNS-consistency tests</strong></p><pre><code>###########################################

</code></pre><h2 id=circumventing-censorship>Circumventing censorship</h2><p>The blocking of WhatsApp&rsquo;s website can be circumvented through the use of
<a href=https://www.torproject.org/>Tor</a>. In cases of DNS hijacking, users might even
be able to access blocked websites by merely [changing their DNS resolver]
(<a href=https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns/docs/using#google_public_dns_ip_addresses>https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns/docs/using#google_public_dns_ip_addresses</a>)
(though this is not something that always works).</p><p>If WhatsApp (or other IM applications) is blocked again, Android users in
Brazil (and elsewhere) can try circumventing censorship by using the
<a href=https://www.torproject.org/docs/android.html.en><strong>VPN mode of Orbot</strong></a>
which enables all apps on their device to run through the [Tor network]
(<a href=https://www.torproject.org/)>https://www.torproject.org/)</a>. It&rsquo;s important though to note that Orbot&rsquo;s VPN
feature should <em>not</em> be used for anonymity, but only for bypassing censorship.</p><h2 id=limitations-to-our-study>Limitations to our study</h2><p>Currently <a href=https://github.com/TheTorProject/ooni-spec>OONI software tests</a> are
<em>not</em> specifically designed to test instant messaging (IM) applications (such
as WhatsApp), but websites. Our measurements are therefore limited to the
testing of WhatsApp&rsquo;s <em>website</em> which was found to be blocked based on DNS
hijacking, and do not include the testing of the WhatsApp application. Over the
next year though we plan to develop <em>new</em> OONI tests which will specifically be
designed for testing IM applications for censorship.</p><p>Until then, the blocking of WhatsApp&rsquo;s website and web app can be tested
