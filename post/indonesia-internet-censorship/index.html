Indonesian ISPs appear to be implementing block pages primarily through DNS hijacking.</p><p><strong><em>Vimeo and Reddit were found to be blocked</em></strong> in some networks in Indonesia, even though their <a href=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2014/11/07/ministry-allows-vimeo-keeps-ban-pornography.html>ban was lifted</a> more than two years ago. A popular <strong>animal rights site was also found to be blocked</strong> , possibly because it was mistaken for a pornographic website due to its domain (peta.xxx). These cases raise the <strong><em>need for oversight</em></strong> , to prevent ISPs from blocking content at their own discretion and to ensure that sites are unblocked after bans are lifted.</p><p>Under the MICT‚Äôs <a href=https://ppidkemkominfo.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/pm-19-tahun-2014-tentang-situs-negatif.pdf>2014 decree</a>, however, Indonesian ISPs are granted the authority to ban &ldquo;negative content&rdquo; at their own discretion, regardless of whether such sites are included in the MICT‚Äôs official Trust Positif <a href="http://trustpositif.kominfo.go.id/files/downloads/index.php?dir=database">blocklists</a>. This excessive authority granted to Indonesian ISPs may explain why many different types of sites were found to be blocked across different networks.</p><p>Multiple <strong>sites expressing criticism towards Islam</strong> were found to be blocked, possibly under <a href=https://www.unodc.org/res/cld/document/idn/indonesian_penal_code_html/I.1_Criminal_Code.pdf>Article 156(a) of Indonesia‚Äôs Criminal Code</a> which prohibits blasphemy against religions. Even though Indonesia‚Äôs government <a href=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2017/01/07/indonesia-blocks-800000-websites.html>announced</a> that it would primarily be blocking sites hosting pornographic materials and gambling applications, we found numerous other sites to be blocked as well.</p><p>These include:</p><ul><li>LGBT sites;</li><li>A <a href=http://indonbodoh.blogspot.com>blog</a> expressing political criticism;</li><li>An <a href=http://www.freespeech.org>independent U.S. news outlet</a>;</li><li>A <a href=http://guerrillagirls.com>site</a>, led by female activist artists, that defends gender and ethnic rights;</li><li>Anonymity tool sites;</li><li>Hosting platforms;</li><li>An <a href=http://www.systranbox.com>online translator</a>;</li><li>Popular online dating sites;</li><li>Sites promoting sex education and AIDS/HIV prevention;</li><li>A site featuring <a href=http://www.bmezine.com>tattoos and piercings</a>;</li><li>Gaming sites.</li></ul><p>Interestingly enough, we also found sites (web forums and e-commerce sites) that are <em>no longer operational</em> to be blocked nonetheless.</p><p>Many of these censorship events indicate that their implementation was influenced by <strong><em>social and cultural norms</em></strong> , especially since the legal justification behind the blocking of many of these sites remains unclear. This raises the <strong><em>need for transparency and accountability</em></strong> to ensure that the implementation of internet censorship is legally proportionate.</p><p>Network tampering was <a href=https://gist.github.com/hellais/7a54e1f765022eb7820aa5989c876675>detected</a> across 10 different Indonesian ISPs, possibly indicating the presence of middleboxes that could be responsible for internet censorship, surveillance, and traffic manipulation. A middle box was <a href=https://explorer.ooni.org/measurement/20161219T000049Z_AS17974_VIUyHiQj5rKlMP1hTxg0IYVU6tkX8ovozq2JHHaA7Wjy9ZXbwz>detected</a> in the Telekomunikasi Indonesia (AS17974) network. While it‚Äôs unclear if this specific system was used to implement internet censorship, it‚Äôs worth emphasizing that most measurements collected from this network presented signs of network tampering, and that this ISP served block pages for many of the sites that were tested as part of this study.</p><p>On a positive note, the <a href=http://torproject.org/>Tor network</a>, Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp appear to have mostly been accessible in Indonesia throughout the testing period.</p><h1 id=introduction>Introduction</h1><p>Six months ago, the Indonesian government <a href=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2017/01/07/indonesia-blocks-800000-websites.html>announced the blocking of 800,000 websites</a> containing pornographic materials and gambling applications.</p><p>In an attempt to examine internet censorship in Indonesia, the <a href=https://ooni.org/>Open Observatory of Network Interference (OONI)</a> collaborated with <a href=http://sinarproject.org/>Sinar Project</a> on the collection and analysis of network measurements.</p><p>The aim of this study is to increase transparency of information controls in Indonesia and to collect data that can potentially corroborate rumours and reports of internet censorship events.</p><p>The following sections of this report provide information about Indonesia‚Äôs network landscape and internet penetration levels, its legal environment with respect to free of expression, access to information and privacy, as well as about cases of censorship and surveillance that have previously been reported in the country. The remainder of the report documents the methodology and findings of this study.</p><h1 id=background>Background</h1><p>Indonesia is a <a href=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/id.html>presidential republic</a> in Southeast Asia with a population of <a href=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/id.html>over 260 million</a>, making it the world&rsquo;s fourth most populous country. Geographically, it is the largest archipelago consisting of over 17,000 islands, with most of its population concentrated in the major islands of Java and Sumatera. Out of 17,000 islands, only about 6,000 are inhabited, and half of the country&rsquo;s population resides in Java alone.</p><p>Indonesia is ethnically diverse, with over 300 distinct ethnic groups. The majority of its population is <a href=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/id.html>comprised</a> of the Javanese (40.1%). The largest non-Javanese groups are the Sundanese (15.5%), ethnic Malays (3.7%), and the Madurese (3%). The Chinese Indonesians are an influential ethnic minority, even though they only comprise 1.2% of the population. There remains considerable resentment and anti-Chinese violence against the Chinese Indonesians on the widely held sentiment that most of Indonesia&rsquo;s wealth and commerce are dominated by the Chinese, although<a href=http://www.scmp.com/week-asia/business/article/2018037/why-chinese-indonesians-dont-have-hide-any-longer> no credible research</a> exists to support that.</p><p>Although Article 28 of the <a href=https://web.archive.org/web/20060109203358/http://www.us-asean.org/Indonesia/constitution.htm>Indonesian constitution</a> provides for freedom of religion, the Indonesian government officially <a href=https://web.archive.org/web/20060109203358/http://www.us-asean.org/Indonesia/constitution.htm>recognises</a> only 6 religions: Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, Confucianism, Protestantism, and Roman Catholicism.</p><p>Indonesia is the most populous Muslim majority country, with an estimated <a href="http://sp2010.bps.go.id/index.php/site/tabel?tid=321&wid=0">87.2%</a> of the population being Muslim, making up 13% of the world&rsquo;s total Muslim population. As such, there are consternations about social and religious issues pervading into discussions on policy and governance, marked by the growing divide between Indonesia&rsquo;s self proclaimed heritage of pluralistic tolerance and the deepening conservatism of Indonesian Islam.</p><p>The recent <a href=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2017/05/09/ahok-guilty-of-blasphemy-sentenced-to-two-years.html>conviction</a> of ethnically Chinese-Christian politician Basuki ‚ÄúAhok‚Äù Tjahaja Purnama, who was charged under Indonesia&rsquo;s blasphemy laws for his <a href=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/12/jakarta-governor-ahoks-blasphemy-trial-all-you-need-to-know>provocative criticisms</a> of a Quranic verse on electing non-Muslim leaders have been a wake-up call on the exploitation of religion by the <a href=http://www.cnbc.com/2016/11/10/how-the-islamic-state-is-exploiting-jakarta-elections.html>Islamic State</a> and the <a href=http://indonesiaatmelbourne.unimelb.edu.au/bigger-than-ahok-explaining-jakartas-2-december-mass-rally/>political elite</a> in undermining the government and boosting their own prospects.</p><p>Indonesia ranks as a corrupt nation, with a <a href=http://www.transparency.org/news/feature/corruption_perceptions_index_2016>Corruption Perceptions Index</a> rating of 37 out of 100 as of 2016, ranking 90 out of 176 countries. Ahok‚Äôs conviction and the racially charged anti-Ahok rallies preceding that have played a role in revealing the <a href=http://indonesiaatmelbourne.unimelb.edu.au/bigger-than-ahok-explaining-jakartas-2-december-mass-rally/>worrying surge</a> of religious intolerance and fundamentalist Islamic hard-liners who have been allowed to the forefront of national attention. A recent <a href=http://www.voanews.com/a/majority-of-religion-school-teachers-in-indonesia-support-sharia-law/3652387.html>survey</a> revealed that about 80% of Islamic religious teachers across five of Indonesia&rsquo;s 34 provinces were in support of the implementation of the Sharia law, further concurred by a<a href=http://www.pewglobal.org/files/2016/04/Pew-Research-Center-Political-Islam-Report-FINAL-April-27-2016.pdf> Pew research study</a> which placed the figure at 72% over all surveyed Indonesian Muslims.</p><p>With the threat of terrorism that Indonesia has faced - from the deadly <a href=http://time.com/4180220/indonesia-terrorist-attacks-history-jakarta/>terrorist attacks and bombings</a> by Islamic extremists over the course of Indonesia&rsquo;s history which remain imprinted in the country&rsquo;s security landscape, to the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papua_conflict>ongoing</a> human rights violations and military suppression of Papuan activists from Papuan separatist movements since the 1960s - there is also worry that such challenges may be used as justification by the Indonesian government for the utilisation of surveillance against these ‚Äúopponents‚Äù of national stability.</p><h1 id=network-landscape-and-internet-penetration>Network landscape and internet penetration</h1><p>Due to its unique geography as an archipelago consisting of more than 17,000 islands, Indonesia<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/02/technology/02iht-indoporn02.html?_r=2&src=busln."> lacks a centralized internet infrastructure</a>, and has several connections to foreign networks.</p><p>Indonesia has over 300<a href=https://apjii.or.id/anggota/index> ISPs</a>, though only 35 of them<a href=https://citizenlab.org/2013/10/igf-2013-an-overview-of-indonesian-internet-infrastructure-and-governance/> own network infrastructure</a>.

The survey also revealed the ubiquity of mobile devices as the preferred medium of access of Indonesian internet users: 47.6% of users accessed the internet primarily through mobile phones, 50.7% through both computers and mobile devices, and only 1.7% that primarily accessed the internet through computer usage.</p><h1 id=legal-environment>Legal environment</h1><h2 id=freedom-of-expression>Freedom of expression</h2><p><strong>Articles 27 & 45 of the 2008 Electronic Information and Transactions (ITE) Law</strong></p><p>Articles 27 and 45 of the 2008<a href=https://www.bu.edu/bucflp/files/2012/01/Law-No.-11-Concerning-Electronic-Information-and-Transactions.pdf> ITE</a> law have been used to prosecute individuals who ‚Äúknowingly and without authority‚Äù distribute, transmit, or make accessible electronic information or documents containing (i) material against propriety, (ii) gambling material, (iii) defamatory material, and (iv) material containing extortions or threats. Under Article 45, any individuals satisfying any of the elements could be sentenced to imprisonment of up to 6 years, and/or a maximum fine of 1 billion rupiah. The <a href=https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0TLwqtdIKa3RmZxdkczczR0OGs/view>2016 amendment</a> to Article 45 reduces the criminal sanction for the crime under Article27(iii) regarding defamation to a maximum imprisonment term of 4 years and a fine of 750 million rupiah, in addition to clarifying that the provision for the dissemination of defamatory material is a crime by complaint.</p><p><strong>2013 Law on Civil Society Organizations</strong></p><p>The <a href=https://ingo.kemlu.go.id/uu/UU%20No%2017%20Tahun%202013-eng.pdf>2013 Civil Society Organizations Law</a> subjects civil society organisations (CSOs) to increased bureaucratic and discriminatory controls, authorizing government screening of all CSOs in the country. The law stipulates CSOs to various prohibitions and obligations to be able to obtain a permit to operate within the country, including prohibiting CSOs from propagating ideologies conflicting with the state ideology of <em>Pancasila</em> , which embraces the five principles of Indonesian nationalism; internationalism; consent or democracy; social prosperity; and belief in one God, thus directly infringing upon the rights of organizations to freedom of religion.</p><p>The law places severe limitations on the running of foreign-funded CSOs within the country. Article 52 of the law prohibits CSOs founded by foreign citizens from conducting any intelligence or political activities, or any activities which may ‚Äúdisrupt the stability and integrity‚Äù of Indonesia or which may ‚Äúdisrupt diplomatic relations‚Äù.</p><p>Article 52(g) prohibits the ‚Äúraising of funds from the Indonesian community‚Äù; and (h) ‚Äúthe use of facilities and infrastructures of government agencies and institutions‚Äù. Violations of such repressive provisions may result in the dissolution of the CSO.</p><h2 id=press-freedom>Press freedom</h2><p><strong>1999 Press Law</strong></p><p>Article 4 of the <a href=http://presscouncil.or.id/fileuploadmaster/956695Indonesian%20Press%20Law_ok%208%20juni%202012.pdf>1999 Press Law</a> guarantees freedom of the press as a basic human right for every citizen. The law contains many positive stipulations which serve to protect the freedom of the press. 4(2) provides that the national press shall not have censorship or broadcast limitations imposed upon it, while 4(3) provides the national press with the right to seek, acquire, and disseminate ideas and information freely to insure the freedom of the press.</p><p>However, the Press Law also contains a number of potentially harmful restrictions on content which may be open to abuse. Article 5 of the law constrains the national press to reporting events and opinions with respect to the religious and moral norms of the public, in accordance with the presumption of innocence. This places restriction on forms of expressions such as legitimate criticisms of religious bodies, which contradicts the stipulation in Article 6 that provides that the national press plays its role in fulfilling the public‚Äôs right to know, and in providing criticism, correction and suggestion towards public concerns.</p><h2 id=access-to-information>Access to information</h2><p><strong>2008 Law on Public Information Openness</strong></p><p>The <a href=https://ppidkemkominfo.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/act-of-the-republic-of-indonesia-number-14-of-2008-on-public-information-openness.pdf>2008 Law on Public Information Openness</a> guarantees freedom of information as a right for Public Information Requesters, restricted only to Indonesian citizens or legal entities. Under Articles 22 and 35, requests for information require that the name, address and the reason for the request of be provided by requesters. Problematically, the law would enable the <a href=https://www.article19.org/resources.php/resource/38157/en/country-report:-the-right-to-information-in-indonesia>possibility of sanitization</a> of requested documents, allowing for the redaction or ‚Äúblackening‚Äù of restricted information while providing access to the rest of the document.</p><p>Under the law, criminal sanctions are provided for public officials found to deliberately disregard their obligation to provide and publish public information.

The MICT has also attempted to impose such discriminatory guidelines on social media and communication apps: public complaints and an <a href=http://bit.ly/1RPDzcQ>advisory discussion panel</a> by the MICT on controversial stickers conveying LGBT themes on the LINE messaging app ultimately led to the <a href=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/12/indonesia-bans-gay-emoji-and-stickers-from-messaging-apps>removal of the stickers</a> from LINE&rsquo;s store, at the MICT&rsquo;s request.</p><p><strong>Censorship of Papuan based news sites</strong></p><p>Despite Indonesian president Joko Widodo&rsquo;s <a href=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-05-11/indonesia-opens-restive-papuan-provices-to-media/6459068>lifting of decades-long media restrictions</a> on foreign journalists which prevented them from travelling to the politically sensitive provinces of Papua and West Papua in 2015, SuaraPapua.com, a prominent news site covering human rights violations in Papua, was found to be <a href=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2016/12/21/jakarta-keeps-strong-grip-on-papua-as-rallies-intensify.html>blocked</a> by the Indonesian government in November 2016 for containing &ldquo;negative content&rdquo; under existing Indonesian law.

By default, Web Connectivity examines the ‚Äú<a href=https://github.com/citizenlab/test-lists/blob/master/lists/global.csv>global test list</a>‚Äù, which includes a wide range of internationally relevant websites, most of which are in English. These websites fall under <a href=https://github.com/citizenlab/test-lists/blob/master/lists/00-LEGEND-new_category_codes.csv>31 categories</a>, ranging from news media, file sharing and culture, to provocative or objectionable categories, like pornography, political criticism, and hate speech.</p><p>These categories help ensure that a wide range of different types of websites are tested, and they enable the examination of the impact of censorship events (for example, if the majority of the websites found to be blocked in a country fall under the ‚Äúhuman rights‚Äù category, that may have a bigger impact than other types of websites being blocked elsewhere). The main reason why objectionable categories (such as ‚Äúpornography‚Äù and ‚Äúhate speech‚Äù) are included for testing is because they are more likely to be blocked due to their nature, enabling the development of heuristics for detecting censorship elsewhere within a country.</p><p>In addition to testing the URLs included in the global test list, Web Connectivity is also designed to examine a test list which is specifically created for the country that the user is running OONI Probe from, if such a list exists. Unlike the global test list, <a href=https://github.com/citizenlab/test-lists/tree/master/lists>country-specific test lists</a> include websites that are relevant and commonly accessed within specific countries, and such websites are often in local languages. Similarly to the global test list, country-specific test lists include websites that fall under the same set of <a href=https://github.com/citizenlab/test-lists/blob/master/lists/00-LEGEND-new_category_codes.csv>31 categories</a>, as explained previously. All test lists are hosted by the <a href=https://citizenlab.org/>Citizen Lab</a> on <a href=https://github.com/citizenlab/test-lists>GitHub</a>, supporting OONI and other network measurement projects in the creation and maintenance of lists of URLs to test for censorship.</p><p>As part of this study, OONI‚Äôs Web Connectivity test examined the accessibility of URLs included in both the ‚Äú<a href=https://github.com/citizenlab/test-lists/blob/master/lists/global.csv>global test list</a>‚Äù (containing 1,105 URLs) and in the ‚Äú<a href=https://github.com/citizenlab/test-lists/blob/master/lists/id.csv>Indonesian test list</a>‚Äù (containing 160 URLs). In total, Web Connectivity tests <strong>measured 1,765 URLs</strong> for censorship across 21 local vantage points in Indonesia between June 2016 to March 2017.</p><p>OONI‚Äôs Web Connectivity test is designed to perform the following:</p><ul><li>Resolver identification</li><li>DNS lookup</li><li>TCP connect</li><li>HTTP GET request</li></ul><p>By default, this test performs the above (excluding the first step, which is performed only over the network of the user) both over a control server and over the network of the user. If the results from both networks match, then there is no clear sign of network interference; but if the results are different, the websites that the user is testing are likely censored.</p><p>Further information is provided below, explaining how each step performed under the web connectivity test works.</p><p><strong>1. Resolver identification</strong></p><p>The domain name system (DNS) is what is responsible for transforming a host name (e.g. torproject.org) into an IP address (e.g. 38.229.72.16). Internet Service Providers (ISPs), amongst others, run DNS resolvers which map IP addresses to hostnames. In some circumstances though, ISPs map the requested host names to the wrong IP addresses, which is a form of tampering.</p><p>As a first step, the Web Connectivity test attempts to identify which DNS resolver is being used by the user. It does so by performing a DNS query to special domains (such as whoami.akamai.com) which will disclose the IP address of the resolver.</p><p><strong>2. DNS lookup</strong></p><p>Once the Web Connectivity test has identified the DNS resolver of the user, it then attempts to identify which addresses are mapped to the tested host names by the resolver. It does so by performing a DNS lookup, which asks the resolver to disclose which IP addresses are mapped to the tested host names, as well as which other host names are linked to the tested host names under DNS queries.</p><p><strong>3. TCP connect</strong></p><p>The Web Connectivity test will then try to connect to the tested websites by attempting to establish a TCP session on port 80 (or port 443 for URLs that begin with HTTPS) for the list of IP addresses that were identified in the previous step (DNS lookup).</p><p><strong>4. HTTP GET request</strong></p><p>As the Web Connectivity test connects to tested websites (through the previous step), it sends requests through the HTTP protocol to the servers which are hosting those websites. A server normally responds to an HTTP GET request with the content of the webpage that is requested.</p><p><strong>Comparison of results: Identifying censorship</strong></p><p>Once the above steps of the web connectivity test are performed <em>both</em> over a control server and over the network of the user, the collected results are then compared with the aim of identifying whether and how tested websites are tampered with. If the compared results do <em>not</em> match, then there is a sign of network interference.</p><p>Below are the conditions under which the following types of blocking are identified:</p><ul><li><strong>DNS blocking:</strong> If the DNS responses (such as the IP addresses mapped to host names) do <em>not</em> match.</li><li><strong>TCP/IP blocking:</strong> If a TCP session to connect to websites was <em>not</em> established over the network of the user.</li><li><strong>HTTP blocking:</strong> If the HTTP request over the user‚Äôs network failed, or the HTTP status codes don‚Äôt match, or all of the following apply:<ul><li>The body length of compared websites (over the control server and the network of the user) differs by some percentage;</li><li>The HTTP headers names do not match;</li><li>The HTML title tags do not match.</li></ul></li></ul><p>It‚Äôs important to note, however, that DNS resolvers, such as Google or a local ISP, often provide users with IP addresses that are closest to them geographically. Often this is <em>not</em> done with the intent of network tampering, but merely for the purpose of providing users with localized content or faster access to websites. As a result, some false positives might arise in OONI measurements. Other false positives might occur when tested websites serve different content depending on the country that the user is connecting from, or in the cases when websites return failures even though they are not tampered with.</p><h4 id=http-invalid-request-line>HTTP Invalid Request Line</h4><p>This <a href=https://ooni.org/nettest/http-invalid-request-line/>test</a> tries to detect the presence of network components (‚Äúmiddle box‚Äù) which could be responsible for censorship and/or traffic manipulation.</p><p>Instead of sending a normal HTTP request, this test sends an invalid HTTP request line - containing an invalid HTTP version number, an invalid field count and a huge request method ‚Äì to an echo service listening on the standard HTTP port. An echo service is a very useful debugging and measurement tool, which simply sends back to the originating source any data it receives. If a middle box is not present in the network between the user and an echo service, then the echo service will send the invalid HTTP request line back to the user, exactly as it received it. In such cases, there is no visible traffic manipulation in the tested network.</p><p>If, however, a middle box is present in the tested network, the invalid HTTP request line will be intercepted by the middle box and this may trigger an error and that will subsequently be sent back to OONI‚Äôs server. Such errors indicate that software for traffic manipulation is likely placed in the tested network, though it‚Äôs not always clear what that software is. In some cases though, censorship and/or surveillance vendors can be identified through the error messages in the received HTTP response. Based on this technique, OONI has previously <a href=https://explorer.ooni.org/highlights/>detected</a> the use of BlueCoat, Squid and Privoxy proxy technologies in networks across multiple countries around the world.</p><p>It‚Äôs important though to note that a false negative could potentially occur in the hypothetical instance that ISPs are using highly sophisticated censorship and/or surveillance software that is specifically designed to not trigger errors when receiving invalid HTTP request lines like the ones of this test. Furthermore, the presence of a middle box is not necessarily indicative of traffic manipulation, as they are often used in networks for caching purposes.</p><h4 id=http-header-field-manipulation>HTTP Header Field Manipulation</h4><p>This <a href=https://ooni.org/nettest/http-header-field-manipulation/>test</a> also tries to detect the presence of network components (‚Äúmiddle box‚Äù) which could be responsible for censorship and/or traffic manipulation.</p><p>HTTP is a protocol which transfers or exchanges data across the internet. It does so by handling a client‚Äôs request to connect to a server, and a server‚Äôs response to a client‚Äôs request. Every time a user connects to a server, the user (client) sends a request through the HTTP protocol to that server. Such requests include ‚ÄúHTTP headers‚Äù, which transmit various types of information, including the user‚Äôs device operating system and the type of browser that is being used. If Firefox is used on Windows, for example, the ‚Äúuser agent header‚Äù in the HTTP request will tell the server that a Firefox browser is being used on a Windows operating system.</p><p>This test emulates an HTTP request towards a server, but sends HTTP headers that have variations in capitalization. In other words, this test sends HTTP requests which include valid, but non-canonical HTTP headers. Such requests are sent to a backend control server which sends back any data it receives. If OONI receives the HTTP headers exactly as they were sent, then there is no visible presence of a ‚Äúmiddle box‚Äù in the network that could be responsible for censorship, surveillance and/or traffic manipulation. If, however, such software is present in the tested network, it will likely normalize the invalid headers that are sent or add extra headers.</p><p>Depending on whether the HTTP headers that are sent and received from a backend control server are the same or not, OONI is able to evaluate whether software ‚Äì which could be responsible for traffic manipulation ‚Äì is present in the tested network.</p><p>False negatives, however, could potentially occur in the hypothetical instance that ISPs are using highly sophisticated software that is specifically designed to not interfere with HTTP headers when it receives them. Furthermore, the presence of a middle box is not necessarily indicative of traffic manipulation, as they are often used in networks for caching purposes.</p><h4 id=vanilla-tor>Vanilla Tor</h4><p>This <a href=https://ooni.org/nettest/vanilla-tor/>test</a> examines the reachability of the <a href=https://www.torproject.org/>Tor network</a>, which is designed for online anonymity and censorship circumvention.</p><p>The Vanilla Tor test attempts to start a connection to the Tor network. If the test successfully bootstraps a connection within a predefined amount of seconds (300 by default), then Tor is considered to be reachable from the vantage point of the user. But if the test does not manage to establish a connection, then the Tor network is likely blocked within the tested network.</p><h4 id=whatsapp-test>WhatsApp test</h4><p>This<a href=https://ooni.org/nettest/whatsapp/> test</a> is designed to examine the reachability of both WhatsApp‚Äôs app and the WhatsApp web version within a tested network.</p><p>OONI‚Äôs WhatsApp test attempts to perform an HTTP GET request, TCP connection and DNS lookup to WhatsApp‚Äôs endpoints, registration service and web version over the vantage point of the user. Based on this methodology, WhatsApp‚Äôs <em>app</em> is likely blocked if any of the following apply:</p><ul><li>TCP connections to WhatsApp‚Äôs endpoints fail;</li><li>TCP connections to WhatsApp‚Äôs registration service fail;</li><li>DNS lookups resolve to IP addresses that are <em>not</em> allocated to WhatsApp;</li><li>HTTP requests to WhatsApp‚Äôs registration service do <em>not</em> send back a response to OONI‚Äôs servers.</li></ul><p>WhatsApp‚Äôs <em>web interface</em> is likely blocked if any of the following apply:</p><ul><li>TCP connections to web.whatsapp.com fail;</li><li>DNS lookup illustrates that a different IP addresses has been allocated to web.whatsapp.com;</li><li>HTTP requests to web.whatsapp.com do <em>not</em> send back a consistent response to OONI‚Äôs servers.</li></ul><h4 id=facebook-messenger-test>Facebook Messenger test</h4><p>This <a href=https://ooni.org/nettest/facebook-messenger/>test</a> is designed to examine the reachability of Facebook Messenger within a tested network.</p><p>OONI‚Äôs Facebook Messenger test attempts to perform a TCP connection and DNS lookup to Facebook‚Äôs endpoints over the vantage point of the user. Based on this methodology, Facebook Messenger is likely blocked if one or both of the following apply:</p><ul><li>TCP connections to Facebook‚Äôs endpoints fail;</li><li>DNS lookups to domains associated to Facebook do not resolve to IP addresses allocated to Facebook.</li></ul><h3 id=data-analysis>Data analysis</h3><p>Through its <a href=https://github.com/TheTorProject/ooni-pipeline>data pipeline</a>, OONI processes all network measurements that it collects, including the following types of data:</p><p><strong>Country code</strong></p><p>OONI by default collects the code which corresponds to the country from which the user is running OONI Probe tests from, by automatically searching for it based on the user‚Äôs IP address through the <a href=https://www.maxmind.com/en/home>MaxMind GeoIP database</a>. The collection of country codes is an important part of OONI‚Äôs research, as it enables OONI to map out global network measurements and to identify where network interferences take place.</p><p><strong>Autonomous System Number (ASN)</strong></p><p>OONI by default collects the Autonomous System Number (ASN) which corresponds to the network that a user is running OONI Probe tests from. The collection of the ASN is useful to OONI‚Äôs research because it reveals the specific network provider (such as Vodafone) of a user. Such information can increase transparency in regards to which network providers are implementing censorship or other forms of network interference.</p><p><strong>Date and time of measurements</strong></p><p>OONI by default collects the time and date of when tests were run. This information helps OONI evaluate when network interferences occur and to compare them across time.</p><p><strong>IP addresses and other information</strong></p><p>OONI does <em>not</em> deliberately collect or store users‚Äô IP addresses. In fact, OONI takes measures to remove users‚Äô IP addresses from the collected measurements, to protect its users from <a href=https://ooni.org/about/risks/>potential risks</a>.</p><p>However, OONI might <em>unintentionally</em> collect users‚Äô IP addresses and other potentially personally-identifiable information, if such information is included in the HTTP headers or other metadata of measurements. This, for example, can occur if the tested websites include tracking technologies or custom content based on a user‚Äôs network location.</p><p><strong>Network measurements</strong></p><p>The types of network measurements that OONI collects depend on the types of tests that are run. Specifications about each OONI test can be viewed through its <a href=https://github.com/TheTorProject/ooni-spec/tree/master/test-specs>git repository</a>, and details about what collected network measurements entail can be viewed through <a href=https://explorer.ooni.org/world/>OONI Explorer</a> or through <a href=https://api.ooni.io/>OONI‚Äôs measurement API</a>.</p><p>OONI processes the above types of data with the aim of deriving meaning from the collected measurements and, specifically, in an attempt to answer the following types of questions:</p><ul><li>Which types of OONI tests were run?</li><li>In which countries were those tests run?</li><li>In which networks were those tests run?</li><li>When were tests run?</li><li>What types of network interference occurred?</li><li>In which countries did network interference occur?</li><li>In which networks did network interference occur?</li><li>When did network interference occur?</li><li>How did network interference occur?</li></ul><p>To answer such questions, OONI‚Äôs pipeline is designed to process data which is automatically sent to OONI‚Äôs measurement collector by default. The initial processing of network measurements enables the following:</p><ul><li>Attributing measurements to a specific country.</li><li>Attributing measurements to a specific network within a country.</li><li>Distinguishing measurements based on the specific tests that were run for their collection.</li><li>Distinguishing between ‚Äúnormal‚Äù and ‚Äúanomalous‚Äù measurements (the latter indicating that a form of network tampering is likely present).</li><li>Identifying the type of network interference based on a set of heuristics for DNS tampering, TCP/IP blocking, and HTTP blocking.</li><li>Identifying block pages based on a set of heuristics for HTTP blocking.</li><li>Identifying the presence of ‚Äúmiddle boxes‚Äù within tested networks.</li></ul><p>However, false positives emerge within the processed data due to a number of reasons. As explained in the previous section, DNS resolvers (operated by Google or a local ISP) often provide users with IP addresses that are closest to them geographically. While this may appear to be a case of DNS tampering, it is actually done with the intention of providing users with faster access to websites. Similarly, false positives may emerge when tested websites serve different content depending on the country that the user is connecting from, or in the cases when websites return failures even though they are not tampered with.</p><p>Furthermore, measurements indicating HTTP or TCP/IP blocking might actually be due to temporary HTTP or TCP/IP failures, and may not conclusively be a sign of network interference. It is therefore important to test the same sets of websites across time and to cross-correlate data, prior to reaching a conclusion on whether websites are in fact being blocked.</p><p>Since instances of internet censorship differ from country to country and sometimes even from network to network, it is quite challenging to accurately identify them. OONI uses a series of heuristics to try to examine whether a measurement differs from the expected control, but these heuristics can often result in false positives (as explained in the previous section). As a result, <strong><em>OONI only confirms instances of blocking when block pages are detected.</em></strong></p><p>OONI‚Äôs methodology for detecting the presence of ‚Äúmiddle boxes‚Äù - systems that could be responsible for censorship, surveillance and traffic manipulation - can also present false negatives, if ISPs are using highly sophisticated software that is specifically designed to <em>not</em> interfere with HTTP headers when it receives them, or to <em>not</em> trigger error messages when receiving invalid HTTP request lines. It remains unclear though if such software is being used. Moreover, it‚Äôs important to note that the presence of a middle box is not necessarily indicative of internet censorship, as such systems are often used in networks for caching purposes.</p><p>OONI continues to develop its data analysis heuristics to identify internet censorship events faster and more accurately.</p><h2 id=findings>Findings</h2><p>As part of this study, <a href=https://explorer.ooni.org/country/ID>network measurements</a> were collected through <a href=https://github.com/TheTorProject/ooni-probe>OONI Probe software tests</a> performed across 21 different local vantage points in Indonesia between 22nd June 2016 and 1st March 2017.</p><p>Upon analysis of the collected network measurements, the findings confirm the <strong>blocking of 161 websites</strong> in Indonesia, and <a href=https://explorer.ooni.org/measurement/20161219T000049Z_AS17974_VIUyHiQj5rKlMP1hTxg0IYVU6tkX8ovozq2JHHaA7Wjy9ZXbwz>reveal the presence of a middle box</a> in the Telekomunikasi Indonesia network.

Such bylaws criminalize consensual same-sex acts in certain provinces, and penalties include up to 100 lashes and up to 100 months of imprisonment.</p><p>LGBT rights movements have faced fierce opposition from Indonesian authorities.

While <a href=https://api.ooni.io/files/by_country/ID>thousands of OONI Probe network measurements have been collected from Indonesia since 2014</a> and continue to be collected on the day of the publication of this report, this study only analyzes network measurements that were collected between <strong>22nd June 2016 to 1st March 2017</strong>. This study is limited to this time frame because we aim to examine the most recent censorship events and because there was a significant increase in the collection of network measurements during this period, in comparison to previous months and years. As such, censorship events which may have occurred before and/or after the analysis period are not examined as part of this study.</p><p>Another limitation to this study is associated to the amount and types of URLs that were tested for censorship. As mentioned in the methodology section of this report, OONI‚Äôs <a href=https://ooni.org/nettest/web-connectivity/>Web Connectivity test</a> was run to examine the accessibility of 160 URLs that are more relevant to the Indonesian context and of 1,105 internationally relevant sites. While a total of <strong>1,765 URLs</strong> were tested for censorship as part of this study, we did not test all of the URLs on the internet, indicating the possibility that other websites not included in <a href=https://github.com/citizenlab/test-lists/tree/master/lists>tests lists</a> might have been blocked.</p><p>Finally, while network measurements were collected from <strong>21 different local vantage points</strong> in Indonesia, <a href=https://github.com/TheTorProject/ooni-probe>OONI‚Äôs software tests</a> were not run consistently across all networks. Stable measurements were collected from certain vantage points throughout the testing period, but less stable measurements were also collected from a number of other vantage points following the <a href=https://ooni.org/post/ooni-mobile-app/>launch of OONI‚Äôs mobile app</a> on 9th February 2017. In other words, once <a href=https://github.com/TheTorProject/ooni-probe>OONI Probe</a> became easier to install and run via its mobile version for Android and iOS, we received an increased amount of sporadic measurements from various new networks. Since tests were not always run consistently, our ability to evaluate whether censorship cases were persistent was limited.</p><h1 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h1><p>Earlier this year, the Indonesian government<a href=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2017/01/07/indonesia-blocks-800000-websites.html> announced the blocking of 800,000 websites</a> and stated that most of these sites contain pornographic material or gambling applications. This study, however, shows that internet censorship events in Indonesia are <em>not</em> restricted to pornography and online gambling. The <strong><em>161 websites</em></strong> (out of 1,756 URLs tested in total) that were confirmed to be blocked as part of this study include news outlets, web forums, LGBT sites, and many others.</p><p>Through the collection and analysis of network measurements, we found many pornographic and gambling sites to be blocked in Indonesia, the censorship of which can be legally justified under the country‚Äôs anti-pornography and anti-gambling laws. But we also found sites that express heavy criticism and hatred towards Islam to be blocked as well, possibly under <a href=https://www.unodc.org/res/cld/document/idn/indonesian_penal_code_html/I.1_Criminal_Code.pdf>Article 156(a) of Indonesia‚Äôs Criminal Code</a> which prohibits blasphemy against religions. The blocking of a site (hightimes.com) that promotes the use of cannabis might be legally justified, since capital punishment is being enforced in the country for drug trafficking.</p><p>It‚Äôs worth emphasizing that we found <strong><em>Vimeo and Reddit to be blocked in some networks</em></strong> in Indonesia, even though their <a href=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2014/11/07/ministry-allows-vimeo-keeps-ban-pornography.html>ban was lifted in November 2014</a> following the election of the country‚Äôs new government. This highlights the <strong><em>need for oversight</em></strong> for the implementation of internet censorship, to ensure that censorship is legally proportionate and that sites are unblocked after bans are lifted.</p><p>Our study also shows that an Indonesian ISP <a href="https://explorer.ooni.org/measurement/20170101T000023Z_AS17974_xpj9FQ8eInz4lCarIF9ZsZgZyyp8JSyfZzzZFB3U0pfkbBS2QB?input=http:%2F%2Fpeta.xxx">blocked</a> access to a <em>popular animal rights website</em> , possibly for having mistaken it for a pornographic website due to its domain (peta.xxx). The site was <a href="https://explorer.ooni.org/measurement/20170228T215956Z_AS17974_u6l0voXmE2JCbP2e5ed9MUyYsdb1KK9eXVDZV7roTeYWJOYnzf?input=http:%2F%2Fpeta.xxx">unblocked</a> a few months later, likely because the ISP noticed that they were censoring an animal rights site instead of pornography. This example is particularly interesting because it highlights two important things: First, Indonesian ISPs appear to be <em>blocking sites at their own discretion</em> under loosely defined government orders. Second, it emphasizes the <strong><em>need for transparency and accountability</em></strong> in terms of government orders and which sites ISPs end up blocking.</p><p>Under the MICT‚Äôs <a href=https://ppidkemkominfo.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/pm-19-tahun-2014-tentang-situs-negatif.pdf>2014 decree</a>, however, Indonesian ISPs are granted the authority to ban ‚Äúnegative content‚Äù at their own discretion, regardless of whether such sites are included in the MICT‚Äôs official Trust Positif <a href="http://trustpositif.kominfo.go.id/files/downloads/index.php?dir=database">blocklists</a>. This excessive authority granted to Indonesian ISPs may explain why many different types of sites were found to be blocked across different networks.</p><p>The findings of this study also show that not all forms of internet censorship are clearly legally justifiable in Indonesia. Last year, Indonesia‚Äôs Communications and Information Ministry announced its <a href=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2016/03/05/government-drafts-ban-lgbt-websites.html>plan to ban LGBT websites</a>, but a relevant law has not been enacted. Yet, as part of this study we found various LGBT sites to be blocked. LGBT rights movements have faced fierce opposition from Indonesian authorities. The country‚Äôs Higher Education Minister <a href=https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/02/11/indonesia-flurry-anti-gay-statements-officials>stated</a> that LGBT people should be barred from university campuses, while the Indonesian Psychiatric Association <a href=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2016/02/24/indonesian-psychiatrists-label-lgbt-mental-disorders.html>classified homosexuality, bisexuality, and transgenderism as mental disorders</a>.</p><p>Multiple other cases of internet censorship, as identified in this study, appear to have been implemented for the <strong><em>reinforcement of social and cultural norms</em></strong> . Sites featuring lingerie and other provocative attire were found to be blocked, possibly under loosely interpreted anti-pornography laws. Five years ago, Indonesia‚Äôs Minister of Religious Affairs <a href=http://www.thenational.ae/news/world/asia-pacific/ministers-bid-to-ban-miniskirts-using-anti-pornography-law-angers-indonesian-women>announced a plan to ban mini-skirts</a> under the assumption that provocative attire can lead to rape. In somewhat similar vein, popular online dating sites, as well as sites providing sex education and information about AIDS/HIV prevention, were also found to be blocked. Even though the Free Speech Coalition (FSC) does <em>not</em> distribute pornography, its site was blocked possibly for supporting and defending those who work in the adult entertainment industry.</p><p>Social and cultural norms (or loosely interpreted laws) may have influenced decisions to block a site (bmezine.com) featuring tattoos and piercings, as well as a blog that appears to express criticism towards Indonesia (indonbodoh.blogspot.com). Similarly, <a href=https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2016/country-chapters/indonesia>limited tolerance</a> may have played a role in the blocking of a site (guerrillagirls.com), led by female activist artists, that defends gender and ethnic rights.</p><p>Interestingly enough, many web forums that are <em>no longer operational</em> were found to be blocked in Indonesia. While the specific motivation and justification behind the blocking of these sites remains unclear, it‚Äôs possible that access to them was restricted if they were viewed as providing a platform for the distribution of provocative or unlawful materials and activities. One of the blocked forums (asianbookie.com/ch/index.cfm?), for example, enabled discussions around sport betting, an activity which is illegal in Indonesia.</p><p>The legal justification behind the blocking of many other sites remains unclear. As part of this study, we found the site of an independent U.S. news outlet (freespeech.org) that is ‚Äú<a href=https://www.freespeech.org/about-us>committed to advancing progressive social change</a>‚Äù to be blocked. Other blocked sites include hosting platforms and sites that offer domain names and SSL certificates. While others include anonymity tools, e-commerce sites (that are no longer operational), gaming sites, and even an online translator.</p><p>Overall, we were able to confirm the <strong><em>blocking of 161 websites</em></strong> through the collection and analysis of network measurements from 21 local vantage points in Indonesia. While the blocking of some of these sites (such as pornography and online gambling) can be legally justified, the justification behind the blocking of many other sites remains unclear. This study provides evidence of internet censorship events in Indonesia, and raises the need for transparency and oversight, to ensure that orders to block online content do not infringe upon human rights.</p><h1 id=acknowledgements>Acknowledgements</h1><p>We thank the <a href=https://www.opentech.fund/>Open Technology Fund (OTF)</a> and
