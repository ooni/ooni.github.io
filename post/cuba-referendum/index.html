According to Andres Pertierra, a Cuban-American historian, the vote not only serves as a referendum on the new constitution, but also on the government of President Miguel Diaz-Canel (who took office last year), providing a measure of legitimacy.</p><p>State media has widely promoted a “yes” vote, while members of the oppositionhave <a href=https://www.14ymedio.com/nacional/Anular-abstenerse-referendum-propone-oposicion_0_2505349445.html>pushed for a “no” or called for abstention</a>.</p><h1 id=blocking-of-independent-media>Blocking of independent media</h1><p>Right before the referendum, <a href=https://www.tremendanota.com/>Tremenda Nota</a>, an independent media outlet that <a href=http://www.diariodecuba.com/cuba/1551005821_44818.html>covers</a> women’s rights, LGBTI and other human rights issues in Cuba, <a href="https://twitter.com/TremendaNota_cu/status/1099465370585518080?s=19">reported</a> that access to their website was blocked in Cuba.</p><p><img src=/post/cuba-referendum/tremenda-nota.png alt></p><p>Their editor <a href=https://www.facebook.com/abel.invernal/posts/2466998813373922>shared the text</a> that they believe motivated the blocking of their website, which criticizes Cuba’s National Assembly for ignoring survey results favourable to LGBTI rights and for not supporting equal marriage in the new constitution.</p><p><a href=https://ooni.org/install/>OONI Probe</a> tests - which are designed to measure the blocking of websites - were run in Cuba, <a href="https://explorer.ooni.io/measurement/20190224T232022Z_AS27725_nclI9vnyHOjiOJrq5ZilcmtRGjeVL15WlGMWDudAY6PVGCTs4j?input=http:%2F%2Fwww.tremendanota.com%2F">confirming the blocking of tremendanota.com</a>. But tremendanota.com is not the only independent media website blocked in Cuba.</p><p>Through the analysis of recent <a href=https://explorer.ooni.io/country/CU>OONI measurements</a>, we found several other independent media websites blocked in Cuba as well on 24th February 2019, during the referendum.</p><p><img src=/post/cuba-referendum/CubaMediaBlocking.png alt></p><p><strong>Source:</strong> Open Observatory of Network Interference (OONI) measurements: Cuba, <a href=https://explorer.ooni.io/country/CU>https://explorer.ooni.io/country/CU</a> </p><p>The above graph shows how the blocking of media websites in Cuba changed over time (since May 2017).</p><p>Previously, Cuba’s telecommunications company (ETECSA) <a href=https://ooni.org/post/cuba-internet-censorship-2017/>mainly blocked the HTTP version of sites by serving blank block pages</a>. This meant that censorship could easily be circumvented by accessing blocked websites over HTTPS (if they supported it). For some sites (cibercuba.com and cubanet.org) that did support HTTPS, OONI measurements from 2017 show failures when performing the HTTP and HTTPS requests, but don’t show the IPs being blocked, suggesting that they may have been using Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) technology.</p><p>Now, we observe that ETECSA has <strong>changed its censorship techniques</strong>, blocking both the HTTP and HTTPS version of sites by means of <strong>IP blocking</strong>. More specifically, ETECSA:</p><ul><li>Has <strong>shifted from serving blank block pages to implementing IP-based blocking</strong> (for sites that support HTTPS, such as 14ymedio.com).</li><li>Continues to serve blank block pages for sites that have not added HTTPS support (such as diariodecuba.com).</li><li>Has shifted to IP-based blocking for sites (such as cibercuba.com and cubanet.org) that previously appeared to be blocked by means of DPI.</li></ul><p>Both cibercuba.com and cubanet.org appear to have temporarily been unblocked (as demonstrated by the accessible measurements from January and early February 2019), suggesting that ETECSA may have made some changes to their censorship equipment around that time.</p><p>Our analysis of <a href=https://explorer.ooni.io/country/CU>OONI measurements</a>, used to produce the above chart, is available <a href=/post/cuba-referendum/20190226-cuba-report-measurements.csv>here</a>.</p><p>The OONI website (ooni.io) has been <a href="https://explorer.ooni.io/measurement/20190224T232022Z_AS27725_nclI9vnyHOjiOJrq5ZilcmtRGjeVL15WlGMWDudAY6PVGCTs4j?input=https:%2F%2Fooni.io%2F">blocked</a> in Cuba as well by means of IP blocking, yet ooni.org is still <a href="https://explorer.ooni.io/measurement/20190225T233901Z_AS27725_WPUkyBF7sttLnVLyPkXngqI2lSIa4Q7kCTDaTcMhyOO3Bi7FEi?input=https:%2F%2Fooni.org%2F">accessible</a>.</p><p>We thank all the OONI Probe users in Cuba who made this study possible.</p></main></div><footer class=p-4><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-12 col-md-4"><div class=pb-2><img src=/images/OONI-HorizontalMonochromeInverted.svg height=32px></div><div class=pb-4>Global community measuring internet censorship around the world.</div><div><div>© 2020 Open Observatory of Network Interference (OONI)</div><div><a href=https://github.com/ooni/license>Content available under a Creative Commons license.</a></div></div></div><div class="col-12 col-md-8"><div class=row><div class="mt-3 col-sm"><div class=footer-section-title>About</div><div class=pt-1><a href=/about/>OONI</a></div><div class=pt-1><a href=/about/data-policy/>Data Policy</a></div><div class=pt-1><a href=https://github.com/ooni/license/tree/master/data>Data License</a></div><div class=pt-1><a href=/about/#contact>Contact</a></div></div><div class="mt-3 col-sm"><div class=footer-section-title>OONI Probe</div><div class=pt-1><a href=https://ooni.org/install/>Install</a></div><div class=pt-1><a href=https://ooni.org/nettest/>Tests</a></div><div class=pt-1><a href=https://github.com/ooni>Source code</a></div><div class=pt-1><a href=https://api.ooni.io/>API</a></div></div><div class="mt-3 col-sm"><div class=footer-section-title>Updates</div><div class=pt-1><a href=/post/>Blog</a></div><div class=pt-1><a href=https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/ooni-talk>Mailing list</a></div><div class=pt-1><a href=https://slack.ooni.org/>Slack</a></div><ul class="pt-1 footer-links-social"><li><a class=twitter href=https://twitter.com/OpenObservatory>Twitter (@OpenObservatory)</a></li><li><a class=youtube href=https://www.youtube.com/c/OONIorg>Youtube (OONIorg)</a></li><li><a class=facebook href=https://facebook.com/ooni.org>Facebook (ooni.org)</a></li><li><a class=instagram href=https://www.instagram.com/openobservatory/>Instagram (@OpenObservatory)</a></li><li><a class=mastodon href=https://mastodon.social/@ooni>Mastodon (@ooni@mastodon.social)</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div></footer></body></html>
