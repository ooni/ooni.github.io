services using DigitalOcean&rsquo;s Frankfurt data centre appeared to be presenting
network connectivity issues from two Egyptian vantage points: Noor ADSL
(<a href=https://stat.ripe.net/AS20928>AS20928</a>) and Vodafone Egypt (ex-RAYA
Telecom, <a href=https://stat.ripe.net/AS24835>AS24835</a>).</p><p>As part of our research we found that one way to consistently reproduce a
network interference is by sending HTTPS requests to the network sub-nets
belonging to DigitalOcean&rsquo;s Frankfurt data center (including, but not limited
to <code>46.101.128.0/24</code>, <code>46.101.172.0/24</code>, <code>46.101.179.0/24</code> —
<a href=https://stat.ripe.net/AS201229>AS201229</a>). Our experiment showed consistent
and heavy throttling of HTTPS services located in the network: only 3% of TCP
connection attempts succeeded.</p><p>Our latency analysis suggests that all the packets that the client was
receiving were <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol#Timeout_based_retransmission>timeout-based TCP
re-transmissions</a>
and that a network device was consistently dropping the first occurrence of
each TCP packet.</p><p>Non-encrypted protocols on the other hand, like plain HTTP, which hosted
services in the same sub-nets were not affected. This indicates that only HTTPS
connections were throttled, while insecure HTTP connections to DigitalOcean&rsquo;s
Frankfurt data centre were successful.</p><p>Based on our tests, the last sample of throttling that we observed occurred on
2016-09-01 12:30 UTC.</p><p>The complete and detailed technical analysis can be found

<a href=https://www.torproject.org/>Tor</a> anonymity network. The collected measurement
data indicates that the Tor process bootstrap was
<a href=https://explorer.ooni.org/measurement/20161026T162218Z_AS36935_kTY80ArJx4baKS9FIss3oPEYfqpzEp0bubESO1T0aEc3Njl3QU>disrupted</a>
by blocking requests to directory authorities, which are designed to help Tor
clients learn the list of relays that make up the Tor network.</p><p>One of the requests that were found to be blocked is a request to download a
&ldquo;consensus&rdquo; document from Tor directory authorities. That request is a plain
HTTP request to the URL:
<code>http://154.35.175.225/tor/status-vote/current/consensus.z</code> from a networking
point of view. Connections to directory authorities are intercepted and
blocking is performed by injecting a packet that terminates the connection
abruptly (a TCP RST packet). This happens right after the server acknowledges
the request.</p><p>The injected RST packets share the same static [IP identification (IP ID)]
(<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4#Identification>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4#Identification</a>) value of <code>0x3412</code> as the
injected RST packets used to block aforementioned websites that we have found to be
blocked. Usage of the same IP ID implies that the blocking infrastructure used
to censor Tor is the same (or similar) to that used to block other websites
(see the in depth <a href=/notebooks/eg-serving-malware.html>technical analysis</a> of
in-band TCP content injections).</p><p>In our testing we found <strong>7 out of 9 directory authority</strong> consensus file requests
to be blocked:</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://explorer.ooni.org/measurement/20161026T205703Z_AS36935_OyfZ1mzzY4xuh8S3abKAfvxcwWGh5JVHUCk55e8cInkOyRmw5U?input=http:%2F%2F128.31.0.39:9131%2Ftor%2Fstatus-vote%2Fcurrent%2Fconsensus.z">Blocking of consensus document requests to the moria1 directory

be blocked</a>
.We did not test the accessibility of the recently added <code>Bitfroest</code> Tor
directory authority, nor do we have samples regarding the potential blocking of
<code>longclaw</code>.</p><p>Also, it&rsquo;s just the set of consensus URLs that are blocked, for example, the
request for <code>/tor/status-vote/current/lack-of-consensus.z</code> produces ordinary
<code>404 Not found</code> error. That implies that the blockage is explicitly targeting
Tor.</p><p>Another type of request that is blocked is the Onion Router handshake sent to
ORPort of the well-known Tor router. They appear to be blocked in the same way:
the TCP connection is interrupted by terminating the connection (with a TCP RST
packet) during the TLS handshake (after the first <code>Client Hello</code> from the
client).</p><p>The blocking appears to only be targeting Tor in a default configuration. This
means that it&rsquo;s possible to easily circumvent such censorship by using any
<a href=https://bridges.torproject.org/>Tor Bridge</a>, including non-obfuscated ones.
Given the fact that the blocking of connections doesn&rsquo;t happen all the time, a
client should be able to bootstrap a Tor connection successfully with enough
retries. This however can, in some cases, take up to a half an hour.
Moreover, OR connections are only blocked to some subset of the public Tor
network, meaning that if a client has already bootstrapped and has a cached
version of the consensus and descriptors it is likely to work properly. The
connection is not throttled as soon as it is established successfully.</p><p>This sort of Tor blockage seems to <em>still</em> be active in the moment of the
publication of this report.</p><p>But this is not the first time we noticed interference with the Tor network in
Egypt. Earlier this month, users reported that they couldn&rsquo;t connect directly
to Tor from Egypt and had to use bridges to access it. Tor Metrics statistics
illustrate that <a href="https://metrics.torproject.org/userstats-relay-country.html?start=2016-09-19&end=2016-10-26&country=eg&events=points">direct
connections</a>
to Tor were reduced on 2nd and 25th October 2016, while the use of
<a href="https://metrics.torproject.org/userstats-bridge-country.html?start=2016-09-19&end=2016-10-26&country=eg">bridges</a>
increased, indicating that Tor might have been blocked. It&rsquo;s probably worth
noting though that only around 30% of Tor users appear to have used bridges to
circumvent potential censorship.</p><p>The following graphs below illustrate the estimated number of
directly-connecting clients and the estimated number of clients connecting via
bridges.</p><p><img src=/post/egypt-network-interference/userstats-relay-country-eg-2016-09-19-2016-10-26-points.png alt="Directly connecting users from Egypt">

one ISP in Egypt: [TE Data] (<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TE_Data)>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TE_Data)</a>. This ISP
accounts for 65% of the <a href=https://www.igmena.org/Indicators-of-Internet-Penetration-in-Egypt>market
share</a> and
controls over 70% of the Egyptian internet bandwidth TE Data appears to be
using DPI or similar network equipment to conduct a man-in-the-middle attack
and transparently inject content for gaining profit (affiliate advertising) or
malicious purposes (serving malware).</p><p>Our experiment showed that there was a 10% probability that mobile device users
connected via Wi-Fi to TE Data ADSL would get redirected when visiting some
porn websites. The redirection injected the URL
<code>http://marketing-sv.com/mads.html</code>, which serves at least two different static
web-pages redirecting to <code>http://go.ad2upapp.com/afu.php?id=788146</code> either
directly or via static pages from <code>utextads.com</code> subdomains. This
PopUp/PopUnder advertisement network is known to be used by malware authors to
gain revenue.</p><p>During our October 2016 investigation the injector was mostly targeting mobile
[User-Agents] (<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_agent)>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_agent)</a>. It was not limited to
iPhone and Android platforms, but also targeted BlackBerry and Symbian devices.
In August 2016 OONI Probe also <a href="https://explorer.ooni.org/measurement/20160827T153815Z_AS8452_gAU19jWom21aUc0hwieYQymbvcuTTTYULW8k1W1UXOlEYmhDPq?input=http:%2F%2Fxnxx.com">captured a similar
injection</a>
in the TE Data network. The injection was redirecting the user to
<code>http://go.ad2upapp.com/afu.php?id=723454</code> that further redirects to
<code>http://go.deliverymodo.com/afu.php?id=723454</code>, a different advertising website
but with the same affiliate ID (723454). We also received user complains about
similar injections in transit traffic of Vodafone 3G
(<a href=https://stat.ripe.net/AS36935>AS36935</a>) and Noor ADSL

sample</a>
served by the chain of web redirects starting with the aforementioned link
during our research. Our IP TTL and network packet latency analysis confirms
that the injection is done in-band using a DPI or similar network equipment to
conduct a man-in-the-middle attack. The analysis refutes the hypothesis of an
&ldquo;infected&rdquo; website serving advertisements instead of content. The statistics
suggest that the injector is located within the TE Data network (not further
than that and not as close as end-user LAN) and transparently injects content
for gaining profit via affiliate advertising.</p><p><code>Client &lt;--(forged packet)-- ISP's middle box &lt;--(valid packet)-- Web server</code></p><h2 id=a-namethird-party-tools-curl-showing-injected-contenta-third-party-tools-curl-showing-injected-content>Third party tools (curl) showing injected content</h2><p>The curl output excerpts below illustrate how TE Data and Noor ISP redirected

services and malicious TCP injections of advertisements and malware content.
ISPs in Egypt appear to be using DPI, TCP injections and network throttling to
block resources, censor websites and serve advertisements and malware to
internet users.</p><p>You can bypass such censorship through the use of
<a href=https://www.torproject.org/>Tor</a> and the <a href=https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en>Tor
Browser</a>. Users in
mobile networks can use
<a href=https://www.torproject.org/docs/android.html.en>Orbot</a> (Tor on Android) to
access the web or other mobile applications by using the VPN mode of Orbot
which enables all apps on the device to run through the <a href=https://www.torproject.org/>Tor
