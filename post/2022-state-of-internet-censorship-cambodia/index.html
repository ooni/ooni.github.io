the current state of internet censorship in Cambodia, the <a href=https://ooni.org/>Open Observatory of Network Interference (OONI)</a>, <a href=https://sinarproject.org/>Sinar Project</a>, and the <a href=https://apiinstitute.org/>Advocacy and Policy Institute</a> collaborated on a joint study to examine whether internet censorship events were persisting in the country through data collection and analysis of network measurements.</p><p>The aim of this study was to increase transparency of internet controls and to collect data that can potentially corroborate rumors and reports of internet censorship events. The following sections of this report provide information about Cambodia’s network landscape and internet penetration levels, its legal environment with respect to freedom of expression, access to information, and privacy, as well as about cases of censorship and surveillance that have previously been reported in the country. The remainder of the report documents key findings of this study.</p><h2 id=background><strong>Background</strong></h2><p>As an old society in Southeast Asia, the Kingdom of Cambodia borders its <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography_of_Cambodia>181,035 km2</a> (69,898 sq mi) territory with <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand>Thailand</a>, <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laos>Laos</a>, <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam>Vietnam</a>, and the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Thailand>Gulf of Thailand</a>, and hosts <a href=https://worldpopulationreview.com/countries/cambodia-population>16.78</a> million population, <a href=https://countrymeters.info/en/Cambodia>51% female</a>. A vast majority is original Khmer, accounting for <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_groups_in_Cambodia>90%</a> of the total population, followed by 5% of Vietnamese, 4% of ethnic minority groups, and 1% of Chinese. Buddhism is officially recognized as a state religion, in which over <a href=https://www.asiahighlights.com/cambodia/religion>97% of the population practice Theravada Buddhism</a>; other religions include Islam, Christianity, and tribal animism.</p><p>After the invasion of Vietnam, the new government installed in early 1979 ruled the country for decades until the first-ever democratic election in 1993. The election was administered by the UN peacemaking council, the so-called UNTAC (<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Transitional_Authority_in_Cambodia>United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia</a>), in which 48 political parties joined, including the four fighting factions. A coalition government was formed and headed by two prime ministers from a long-standing party, CPP (Cambodian People Party) and a royalist party, FUNCINPEC (National United Front for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful and Cooperative Cambodia).</p><p>Civil Society Organizations (CSO) worked intensively to reduce poverty for the rural and affected communities, increase agricultural productivity, increase economic development, promote gender equality and equity, and democratic governance as well as advance democracy and promote human rights. They represent various sectors of work to demand responsive policy and practices from relevant governments and stakeholders. Starting from 2012 onwards, journalists, CSOs and Human Rights Defenders (HRD) embraced the internet as a means to advocate and disseminate their work. The LANGO (Law on Association and NGO) and taxation laws are perceived by several CSOs and experts as tools of the government to restrict NGOs that are critical of the government and the ruling party, in particular NGOs working in democracy, human rights, and advocacy. Some NGOs, like NDI (National Democratic Institute) from the US, were shut down or pushed to do so by the government.</p><p>Several media outlets - television stations and most radio outlets - are aligned with the ruling party<sup id=fnref:15><a href=#fn:15 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>15</a></sup> or the government. A few robust and independent media outlets and NGOs are in trouble with their operations under the conditions set in the LANGO and taxation laws, in particular. The government is criticized for the increased control over the media landscape in the country. Soon after the dissolution of the opposition party, some international media outlets, mainly from the US, were forcefully shut down by the government. Those media could only broadcast their online programs from abroad.</p><p>Activism has emerged in the last decade. Human rights defenders, environmental activists, and farmer activists are prominent in the politics of the kingdom working to demand responsiveness and accountability of the government to the society and constituencies, while citizen journalists become powerful in the media sector on the ground. Their personal movement and relations and online communications are increasingly under the surveillance of the government. Journalists, activists, and other internet users increasingly face physical and online harassment for their online posts. Cambodian journalist, Mr. Kouv Piseth is arrested on the 24 July 2021 after he posted criticisms on Facebook about the Cambodia government’s decision to use China’s Sinopharm and Sinovac vaccines, and Mr. Oun Chhiv was arrested on 28th Sept 2021 after his reporting of the on a land dispute which allegedly involved high-ranking officials in the Botum Sakor National Park, Koh Kong province.<sup id=fnref:16><a href=#fn:16 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>16</a></sup></p><p>Cambodia is claimed by the government as a lower-income country in 2015 and to become a middle-income country by 2030. Such a claim changed the financing landscape. It is implied in the move out of Western NGOs and donor communities, while the influx of Chinese programs and loans for development and business advancement. The internet development of the country dramatically increased in just a few years. Five IPS companies are increasingly investing in this dramatic boom business. All of these companies are from communist and totalist countries, mainly China and Vietnam.</p><p>The government claimed that cybercrimes posed great challenges and threats to national safety and security. To protect these, the government put much more effort into developing and putting into practice laws and legal regulations relating to the media and the internet. In contrast, these laws and legal regulations are criticized as tools to increase the surveillance of the works of CSOs, media, and activists that are critical of the government and the ruling party.</p><h3 id=network-landscape-and-internet-penetration>Network landscape and internet penetration</h3><p>Through its strong relations and influence over the ISPs, the government has expanded its control over the internet. As implied, internet freedom in Cambodia is increasingly under threat. Five major telecommunication firms are providing both land-based and mobile internet services in Cambodia—Viettel, Smart Axiata, CamGSM, Xinwei Telecom, and Southeast Asia Telecom, all originating from countries with authoritarian leanings. Their management is closely affiliated with the Royal Government of Cambodia (RGC) and its officials, and they are likely to provide cover for each other when public scrutiny arises.<sup id=fnref:17><a href=#fn:17 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>17</a></sup> As restricted by the laws on telecommunications, ISPs must have licenses from MPTC.</p><p>Three prominent communication tools in Cambodia are mobile phone, fixed phone and internet. According to the newly functioning <a href=https://trc.gov.kh/en/internet-subscriptions/>Telecommunication Regulators of Cambodia</a> (TRC), the usage of the fixed phone decreased from 227,261 subscribers in 2016 to 39,272 subscribers in 2022 (May). The usage of mobile phone is moderately stable, just slightly decreased from 19.91 million subscribers in 2016 to 19.48 million in May 2022. However, the internet penetration has increased dramatically in 7 years. It increased from 8.09 millions in 2016 to 18.00 million internet subscribers in May 2022. It is worth noting that one person could subscribe to more than one network.</p><h4 id=mobile-subscribers>Mobile Subscribers</h4><p><img src=/post/2022-state-of-internet-censorship-cambodia/images/image1.png></p><p>Source: <a href=https://trc.gov.kh/en/internet-subscriptions/>Telecommunication Regulators of Cambodia</a></p><h4 id=instant-messaging>Instant Messaging</h4><p>Based on the available data, the fixed internet service increased slightly from 283,508 in 2021 to 312,233 in 2022 (May).</p><p>Social media is widely used in Cambodia.

However, these have been criticized as tools of the government to increase the control over the internet usage which are affecting the basic rights to freedom of expression.</p><h4 id=freedom-of-expression>Freedom of expression</h4><h5 id=constitution>Constitution</h5><p>Article 41 of the Constitution guarantees freedom of expression. However, Article 41 stipulates that, in exercising freedom of expression, “no one shall exercise these rights to infringe upon the honor of others, or to affect the good customs of society, public order and national security”. As evidenced in later national legislation and non-legal measures, the state has actively promulgated measures to roll back guarantees of internet freedom based on such concerns regarding honor, public order and national security. Article 41 also provides for regulation of the media: the “regime of the media shall be determined by law”.</p><p>The latest amendment to the Constitution in 2018 further diminished compliance with international standards. An amendment to Article 49 —concerning respect for the constitution and laws and defending the nation—was the most damaging to fundamental freedoms. The amendment now obligates “Every Khmer citizen to uphold national interest” and to refrain from “conducting any activities which either directly or indirectly affect the interests of the Kingdom of Cambodia and of Khmer citizens.” When justifying the necessity of the amendment, Minister of Interior Sar Kheng singled out activists, HRDs and opposition members for their appeals to the international community to impose sanctions on Cambodia over its crackdown on opposition and civil society (Nachemson & Dara, 2018). In such context, it is evident that Article 49 as amended can be easily used to curtail freedom of expression online, especially when the statement criticizes the state or emphasizes a call to action against the State. Any dissent against the government can prompt disproportionate legal actions penalizing the exercise of freedom of expression.<sup id=fnref:21><a href=#fn:21 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>21</a></sup></p><h5 id=penal-code>Penal Code</h5><p>The 2009 Penal Code contains vaguely-worded provisions on “plotting”, sharing “false information" and “incitement to commit a felony,” which have been used to charge internet users for posting and sharing critical content on social media. Criminal defamation is provided for under Article 305 of the 2009 Penal Code. Furthermore, spreading disinformation and conspiracy are criminalized under Article 425 and 453; while laws related to the incitement and provocation to commit crimes are stipulated under Articles 494 and 495. The latest amendment in 2018 introduced Article 437 bis, or the lèse-majesté provision, to the Code.</p><p>Article 305 on public defamation stipulates that “any allegation or slanderous charge that undermines the honor or the reputation of a person or an institution” is a criminal offense. The crime can be committed through several means. These categories of assessment apply to all provisions mentioned in this section and cover the common activities of most users online, such as the writing and sharing of posts on online platforms or social media. If these online actions are deemed defamatory, the act is punishable by fines between US$ 24.60 to US$ 2,460. Article 305, in tandem with other provisions in the Penal Code, have been disproportionately used to silence criticisms by opposition politicians and critics.</p><p>Article 425 (false information) criminalizes the “communication or disclosure of any false information with a view to inducing a belief that a destruction, defacement or damage dangerous to other persons will be carried out”. This has been utilized by local authorities as criminalizing the dissemination of information they perceive as fake news, including critical comments directed at the government that they believe may potentially cause political instability or damage to their reputation. The use of this Article to penalize an individual can result in imprisonment from one to two years, or a fine ranging from $490USD to $981USD.</p><p>Similarly, Article 453 on conspiracy and plotting against the government criminalizes “any scheme set up between several persons to commit a criminal attempt, and this scheme was materialized by one or several concrete actions, constitutes a conspiracy”. Individuals charged can face a minimum of five and up to ten years of imprisonment. The article has been misused to criminalize dissent against the state, even in instances where there is no evidence of plotting.</p><p>The provisions most frequently used to persecute members of the opposition, government critics, activists and media professionals are Articles 494 and 495 (incitement to commit a felony). Under Article 495, incitement to “commit a felony or to disturb social security” by means identified in Article 494, the same as those under Article 305, is “punishable by imprisonment from six months to two years and a fine from one million to four million Riels, where the incitement was ineffective”.</p><p>Article 437 bis (lèse-majesté) prohibits criticism of the King and outlines penalties of between one to five years imprisonment and monetary fines ranging from US$500 to US$2,460. Following Thailand&rsquo;s lead in prosecuting political critics for lèse-majesté, this provision encroaches on social media users’ online freedoms (Boyle and Chhengpor, 2018). Internet users can be charged with this crime through any “word, gesture, writing, picture or other media which affects the dignity of the individual”.<sup id=fnref:22><a href=#fn:22 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>22</a></sup></p><h5 id=law-on-the-management-of-the-nation-in-a-state-of-emergency>Law on the Management of the Nation in a State of Emergency</h5><p>In April 2020, the Cambodian government passed the Law on the Management of the Nation in a State of Emergency, to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. This law was heavily criticized by civil society for providing the government with extensive powers to restrict free expression during a state of emergency.<sup id=fnref:23><a href=#fn:23 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>23</a></sup> It empowered the government to monitor information online, ban or restrict news and media sharing, and implement other measures it deems necessary.<sup id=fnref:24><a href=#fn:24 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>24</a></sup> Prime Minister Hun Sen prepared a royal decree for the King to use if he decided to declare a state of emergency following a COVID-19 outbreak in November 2020; however, the government did not officially declare a state of emergency during the coverage period.<sup id=fnref:25><a href=#fn:25 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>25</a></sup></p><h5 id=2019-draft-law-on-access-to-information>2019 draft Law on Access to Information</h5><p>Containing protections for whistleblowers and having the potential to positively impact free expression online if approved and enforced, the updated draft released to the public in August 2019 raised concerns about the law’s adherence to international human rights standards, as well as its use of broad and unclear standards that could threaten access of information and freedom of expression. For example, the law narrowly defines the type of information and institutions it applies to; lacks effective oversight procedures; permits public authorities to deny disclosure in various overly broad situations; and contains a criminal libel and defamation provision. In August 2020, the law was finalized and was set to be approved by the Council of Ministers<sup id=fnref:26><a href=#fn:26 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>26</a></sup>; however, due to delays because of the pandemic, the law had not yet been sent to parliament until the end of 2021.<sup id=fnref:27><a href=#fn:27 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>27</a></sup></p><h5 id=law-on-telecommunications>Law on Telecommunications</h5><p>The 2015 Law on Telecommunication imposes generic obligations on telecommunications service providers, which authorities claim will enhance service access in the countryside and rural areas. Within the broad range of regulations, however, the law also functions as a legal tool to monitor internet activity. Freedom of expression is threatened through the imposition of monitoring actors (Article 70 and 71), decreased data protection (Article 97 and 6) and the criminalisation of free speech on radio, television, online and in private messages (Article 80).</p><p>Article 6 requires “all telecommunications operators and persons involved with the telecommunications sector” to provide MPTC with “the telecommunications, information and communication technology service data”. The lack of definition of who this legitimate authority is highly problematic and could potentially lead to arbitrary surveillance. Hence the law—by allowing surveillance of electronic devices—enables Cambodian authorities to actively phone-tap and monitor online discourses in order to selectively persecute targeted individuals.</p><p>Article 80 states that the “establishment, installation and utilization of equipment in [the] telecommunication sector, if these acts lead to national insecurity, shall be punished by sentences from 7 to 15 years imprisonment.” The lack of clarity over types of telecommunication activity could heavily punish legitimate expression via radio shows, television, online and even through private messages and phone conversations between individuals, should the authorities determine it to be a threat.<sup id=fnref:28><a href=#fn:28 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>28</a></sup></p><h5 id=cybercrime-law-draft29>Cybercrime Law (Draft)<sup id=fnref:29><a href=#fn:29 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>29</a></sup></h5><p>Proposed in 2012, The law is subject to further changes in response to critical backlash, and as of August 2021, there was no specific date for the completion of the drafting nor for the implementation of the Law. Articles 8 and 12 state that service providers must “preserve traffic data for at least 180 days”, to be shared with “competent authorities” upon their request.</p><p>Articles 32 and 33 criminalize the “unauthorized access” to a computer system or the transferring of data from one system to another without permission. Those charged face up to 10 years imprisonment. These Articles also pose concerns to whistleblowers and HRDs who access such information to expose rights violations by the state, as they are not provided adequate safeguards.</p><p>Article 40 criminalizes the use of computers to initiate “interruptions, fear, threats, abuses, [and] intimidation”. Individuals charged under this Article face a maximum of six months imprisonment. Article 45 criminalizes “any person who knowingly and intentionally makes a false statement or material misrepresentation through information technology” that could be detrimental to “public safety” and “national security”.</p><h4 id=freedom-from-interference>Freedom from interference</h4><p>Press freedom and internet freedom in Cambodia are increasingly under threat. In 2022 ‘<a href=https://freedomhouse.org/country/cambodia>Freedom in the World</a>’ report by Freedom House, Cambodia was classified as “Not Free”. People are afraid to express their view or opinion online, especially those who are critical of the government. The Cambodian government has used the existing laws and legal regulations and developed new ones to increase interference. It was noted that the Criminal Code has been used in cases involving journalists and the COVID-19 Law has been used in cases involving journalists and human rights defenders.</p><p>In 2020, the government enacted legislation to declare a state of emergency that would grant authorities vast powers to conduct digital surveillance, ban assemblies, and ban or limit broadcasting, among other provisions that amounted to virtually unchecked powers. As noted by the <a href=https://freedomhouse.org/country/cambodia/freedom-world/2022>Freedom House</a>, while a state of emergency was never declared, the government issued numerous threats as the global pandemic became apparent, and a number of people, including private citizens and those considered political opponents, were indeed arrested throughout year on the pretext of spreading false information about COVID-19 or purportedly contravening government narratives about public health. In 2021, dozens of people were arrested for criticizing the government’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>According to a recent study of the <a href=https://www.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/2022-08/press-freedom-cambodia-en.pdf>OHCHR</a> that surveyed 35 journalists revealed that journalists have been interfered with. All the respondents reported that they had faced some forms of interference while carrying out their jobs. The most common form of interference was surveillance or arbitrary detention. The record of OHCHR showed that as of May 2022, 4,323 individual instances of arbitrary detention in the context of the strike at NagaWorld Casino. Another record of OHCHR reported since January 2017, 23 journalists have faced criminal charges as a result of their work. In the recent report of <a href=https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2022/08/increasing-attacks-cambodias-media-are-threat-democracy-un-human-rights>OHCHR</a> it is concluded that journalists in Cambodia are increasingly being subjected to various forms of harassment and pressure, as well as violence amid growing restrictions on civic space and press freedoms in the country.</p><h4 id=freedom-from-censorship>Freedom from censorship</h4><p>Censorship has dramatically increased in Cambodia in recent years through different forms. The forceful impose on legal and non-legal measures by the Cambodian government against targeted groups or individuals have negatively restricted the exercise of freedom of expression and internet freedoms.</p><p><a href=https://www.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/2022-08/press-freedom-cambodia-en.pdf>OHCHR</a> argued that while neither Prakas 170 nor the Sub-Decree on the National Internet Gateway are specifically targeted at the media, the potential impact of these instruments on freedom of expression more broadly and press freedom, in particular, is profound. Both instruments vest broad powers in government to censor expression in a manner that appears to go well beyond what is permitted by Article 19(3) of ICCPR, giving rise to situations where government agencies will be empowered to censor expression and reporting that they deem inconvenient. Reflecting the order from the Ministry of Information to ISPs to block the services of 15 independent media outlets or news websites during the previous national election in 2018, it is argued that Prakas 170 and the Sub-Decree on the National Internet Gateway threaten to provide a more formal legislative basis for the closure of websites, including those of news outlets, giving rise to fears of the routing, shutting down of critical voices and reporting.</p><p>People are afraid to speak up against the ruling regime. According to a recent study of the <a href=https://asiacentre.org/wp-content/uploads/Internet-Freedoms-in-Cambodia-A-Gateway-to-Control.pdf>Asiacenter</a>, it is suggested that individuals have taken a step back from sharing their own political opinions online or participating in political events, and instead prefer to simply read or listen to such content as they are afraid to get into trouble with the Cambodian authorities, who have ramped up their control of the online sphere.</p><p>In 2020, according to CCHR’s Cambodia Fundamental Freedoms Monitor report, 108 cases of restriction on freedom of expression by the RGC were reported; out of which 57 cases (53%) occurred online<sup id=fnref:30><a href=#fn:30 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>30</a></sup>. The report suggested that the trend has been consistent in the past three years where 83% (2019), 73% (2018), 69% (2017) of respondents were cautious for their own safety when sending or sharing information over social media. Recently, in 2022, a report from <a href=https://www.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/2022-08/press-freedom-cambodia-en.pdf>OHCHR</a> that interviewed 15 men and six women journalists showed that 60% of them had faced verbal threats in connection with their work. Another study noted that Facebook was the most surveilled online platform, with 46 cases of restrictions on freedom of expression reported, followed by Tiktok (8) and YouTube (7).[^31,]<sup id=fnref:31><a href=#fn:31 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>31</a></sup></p><h4 id=free-access-to-information>Free access to information</h4><p>In line with the international human rights standards and principles concerning access to information, several laws and legal regulations of Cambodia have guaranteed access to information (A2I). Three provisions in the current Cambodian Constitution provide the constitutional underpinnings of a protected right of “timely and effective access to high quality and accurate information held by the Cambodian government and other public institutions&rsquo;&rsquo;. Article 5 of the Press Law recognizes the “right of access to information in government-held records. Article 13 of the 2005 Archive Law states: Public archives, which are published documents, are permitted to be used by the public for research and consultations as unrestricted information. Other public activities shall be permitted for free research 20 years thereafter the date of the documents or thereafter the end of the proceeding, or in special cases as stipulated in Article 14 of this Law.<sup id=fnref:32><a href=#fn:32 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>32</a></sup> The Information Law remains in the draft version till late 2021 since its initiative version was drafted in 2007.</p><p>However, free access to information remains a great challenge. A recent <a href=https://www.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/2022-08/press-freedom-cambodia-en.pdf>study of OHCHR</a> with journalists suggested that journalists are working in an increasingly difficult environment, one that is particularly fraught with difficulties when it comes to accessing information from public sources. While the authorities have adopted laws that seem to curtail the right to freedom of expression, they have delayed finalizing a promised new law that will permit journalists and media personnel to access official information.</p><h4 id=privacy>Privacy</h4><h5 id=inter-ministerial-prakas-proclamation-no-17034>Inter-Ministerial Prakas (Proclamation) No. 170<sup id=fnref:33><a href=#fn:33 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>33</a></sup></h5><p>This Prakas was implemented amidst an environment of stricter controls on online platforms during the elections, such as blocking of pro-democracy websites. The Prakas’ initial proclamation enables the close collaboration between the Ministry of Information, Ministry of Interior and MPTC to monitor social media usage. The regulation directly targets website publications and social media networks within the Cambodian Internet space. Under Clause 6, the Ministry of Information is authorized to manage published online information through electronic systems and “take action” against illegal publications.</p><p>While the Inter-Ministerial Prakas was often called Cambodia’s ‘fake news’ law, it has rarely been used to criminalize the act of disseminating disinformation. Rather, it has been used as a justification for governmental digital surveillance.</p><h5 id=national-internet-gateway35>National Internet Gateway<sup id=fnref:34><a href=#fn:34 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>34</a></sup></h5><p>The Sub-Decree significantly enhances monitoring capacities over user activity, as gateway operators will report their observations on internet usage to the Ministry of Telecommunications. Similar to the Inter-Ministerial Prakas, this law is geared towards online state surveillance rather than criminalizing online activities. Therefore, this new policy is a highly potent tool against online expression and the right to privacy.</p><p>Article 6 of the document describes the functions and duties of the NIG operator. These include the management of access to connection and internet services. This Article, due to vague and overly-broad provisions, allows for the government to block access to sites that propagate critical views against the state, by branding it as information that threatens social order or safety.</p><p>Article 12 (revenue collection, safety, and public order protection) also requires NIG operators to “[assure] safety, public order, dignity, culture, tradition and custom of the society, as well as preventing and cracking down on crimes”. Vague definitions and unclear assessments of what constitutes a crime, or what actions threaten “social order, dignity, culture, traditions, and customs” potentially allows for continued politically motivated prosecution of online activists and internet users. Service providers must also urge users to complete online forms and verify their identities - the collection of such data, with no existing safeguards on data privacy, may result in its use to surveil and monitor internet activity. As such monitoring is already commonplace in Cambodia, the NIG only serves to worsen the situation of internet freedoms and self-censorship.</p><p>Under Article 14, gateway operators are required to store data and provide routine status reports to the authorities. The storage of technical records, IP addresses, and identification of the route of traffic through the NIG for 12 months, allows operators to monitor user activities.</p><h3 id=reported-cases-of-internet-censorship-and-surveillance>Reported cases of internet censorship and surveillance</h3><p>Several cases of internet censorship and surveillance have been reported in Cambodia over the last decade.

As part of this study, this list of URLs was reviewed to include additional URLs - along with <a href=https://github.com/citizenlab/test-lists/blob/master/lists/global.csv>other URLs</a> that are commonly accessed around the world - and tested for blocking based on <a href=https://github.com/TheTorProject/ooni-probe>OONI’s free software tests</a>. A total of 191 URLs from Cambodia were added. Such tests were run from local vantage points in Cambodia, and they also examined whether systems that are responsible for censorship, surveillance, and traffic manipulation were present in the tested network.

Several cases of internet censorship and surveillance have been reported in Cambodia over the last decade. On the 27 and 28 2018 election day, 15 websites of the independent news like voice of America&rsquo;s Khmer service, Radio Free Asia&rsquo;s Khmer service, Voice of Democracy, Vayo FM Radio, Monorom.info and the news site of the Independent Network for Social Justice. were blocked by ISPs through the order from the government authorities.</p><p>Press freedom and internet freedom in Cambodia are increasingly under threat. In 2022, Cambodia was classified as “Not Free”. People are afraid to express their views or opinions online, especially those who are critical of the government. The Cambodian government has used the existing laws and legal regulations and developed new ones to increase interference. Censorship has dramatically increased in Cambodia in recent years through different forms. The forceful imposition of legal and non-legal measures by the Cambodian government against targeted groups or individuals have negatively restricted the exercise of freedom of expression and internet freedoms.</p><p>OONI data showed 43 highly likely blocked websites that are censored by DNS, mainly by VIETTEL (CAMBODIA) PTE., LTD. (AS38623), S.I Group (AS38623) and CAMGSM Company Ltd (AS17976). These websites include news and media websites, and thus raises concern about press freedom, internet freedom and censorship in Cambodia. However, as data from Cambodia currently do not show any block pages, more measurements may be needed in the next round of reporting to make more substantial conclusions.</p><p>Based on the analysis and findings of the report, we reiterate the commendations made by the OHCHR. So, it is recommended that the State review and revise its current and pending legislation, including the Sub-Decree on National Internet Gateway and the amendments to the Press Law and the draft laws on cybercrimes and on access to information to avoid the use of vague terminology and overly broad restrictions. The UN Human Rights Committee further recommended the State to ensure that in the formulation and enforcement of its legislation, including Ministerial Sub-Decrees, any restrictions on the exercise of freedom of expression and association comply with the strict requirements of articles 19 (3) and 22 of the Covenant.</p><h3 id=contribute-to-the-study>Contribute to the study</h3><p>There are various ways one may contribute to the OONI measurements:</p><ul><li>Testing: You may test on <a href=https://ooni.org/install/>various platforms</a>, both on Mobile (iOS and Android) and Desktop, including on the CLI on Linux platforms.

A domain is a name that is commonly attributed to websites (when they’re created), so that they can be more easily accessed and remembered. For example, twitter.com is the domain of the Twitter website. However, computers can’t connect to internet services through domain names, but based on IP addresses: the digital address of each service on the internet. Similarly, in the physical world, you would need the address of a house (rather than the name of the house itself) in order to visit it. The Domain Name System (DNS) is what is responsible for transforming a human- readable domain name (such as ooni.org) into its numerical IP address counterpart (in this case:104.198.14.52), thus allowing your computer to access the intended website.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>HTTP</strong></td><td>The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is the underlying protocol used by the World Wide Web to transfer or exchange data across the internet. The HTTP protocol allows communication between a client and a server. It does so by handling a client’s request to connect to a server, and the server’s response to the client’s request. All websites include an HTTP (or HTTPS) prefix (such as <a href=http://example.com/>http://example.com/</a>) so that your computer (the client) can request and receive the content of a website (hosted on a server). All websites include an HTTP (or HTTPS) prefix (such as <a href=http://example.com/>http://example.com/</a>) so that your computer (the client) can request and receive the content of a website (hosted on a server). The transmission of data over the HTTP protocol is unencrypted.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>ISP</strong></td><td>An Internet Service Provider (ISP) is an organization that provides services for accessing and using the internet. ISPs can be state-owned, commercial, community-owned, non-profit, or otherwise privately owned. Vodafone, AT&amp;T, Airtel, and MTN are examples of ISPs.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Middle boxes</strong></td><td>A middlebox is a computer networking device that transforms, inspects, filters, or otherwise manipulates traffic for purposes other than packet forwarding. Many Internet Service Providers (ISPs) around the world use middleboxes to improve network performance, provide users with faster access to websites, and for a number of other networking purposes. Sometimes though, middleboxes are also used to implement internet censorship and/or surveillance. The OONI Probe app includes two tests designed to measure networks with the aim of identifying the presence of middleboxes.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>TCP</strong></td><td>The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is one of the main protocols on the internet. To connect to a website, your computer needs to establish a TCP connection to the address of that website. TCP works on top of the Internet Protocol (IP), which defines how to address computers on the internet. When speaking to a machine over the TCP protocol you use an IP and port pair, which looks something like this: 10.20.1.1:8080. The main difference between TCP and (another very popular protocol called) UDP is that TCP has the notion of a “connection”, making it a “reliable” transport protocol.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>TLS</strong></td><td>Transport Layer Security (TLS) – also referred to as “SSL” – is a cryptographic protocol that allows you to maintain a secure, encrypted connection between your computer and an internet service. When you connect to a website through TLS, the address of the website will begin with HTTPS (such as <a href=https://www.facebook.com/)>https://www.facebook.com/)</a>, instead of HTTP.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>A comprehensive glossary related to OONI can be accessed here: <a href=https://ooni.org/support/glossary/>https://ooni.org/support/glossary/</a>.</p><h2 id=annex-ii-methodology><strong>Annex II: Methodology</strong></h2><h3 id=data>Data</h3><p>Data computed based on the heuristics for this report can be downloaded here: <a href=https://github.com/Sinar/imap-data>https://github.com/Sinar/imap-data</a> whereas aggregated data can be downloaded from <a href=https://explorer.ooni.org/>OONI Explorer</a>.</p><h3 id=coverage>Coverage</h3><p>The iMAP State of Internet Censorship Country Report covers the findings of network measurement collected through Open Observatory of Network Interference (OONI) <a href=https://ooni.org/install/>OONI Probe App</a> that measures the blocking of websites, instant messaging apps, circumvention tools and network tampering.

OONI takes measures to remove them from the collected measurements, to protect its users from <a href=https://ooni.org/about/risks/>potential risks</a>. However, there may be instances where users’ IP addresses and other potentially personally-identifiable information are unintentionally collected, if such information is included in the HTTP headers or other metadata of measurements. For example, this can occur if the tested websites include tracking technologies or custom content based on a user’s network location.</p><h4 id=network-measurements>Network measurements</h4><p>The types of network measurements that OONI collects depend on the types of tests that are run. Specifications about each OONI test can be viewed through its <a href=https://github.com/ooni/spec>git repository</a>, and details about what collected network measurements entail can be viewed through <a href=https://explorer.ooni.org/world/>OONI Explorer</a> or through <a href=https://api.ooni.io/>OONI’s measurement API</a>.</p><p>In order to derive meaning from the measurements collected, OONI processes the data types mentioned above to answer the following questions:</p><ul><li>Which types of OONI tests were run?</li><li>In which countries were those tests run?</li><li>In which networks were those tests run?</li><li>When were tests run?</li><li>What types of network interference occurred?</li><li>In which countries did network interference occur?</li><li>In which networks did network interference occur?</li><li>When did network interference occur?</li><li>How did network interference occur?</li></ul><p>To answer such questions, OONI’s pipeline is designed to answer such questions by processing network measurements data to enable the following:</p><ul><li>Attributing measurements to a specific country.</li><li>Attributing measurements to a specific network within a country.</li><li>Distinguishing measurements based on the specific tests that were run for their collection.</li><li>Distinguishing between “normal” and “anomalous” measurements (the latter indicating that a form of network tampering is likely present).</li><li>Identifying the type of network interference based on a set of heuristics for DNS tampering, TCP/IP blocking, and HTTP blocking.</li><li>Identifying block pages based on a set of heuristics for HTTP blocking.</li><li>Identifying the presence of “middle boxes” within tested networks.</li></ul><p>According to OONI, false positives may occur within the processed data due to a number of reasons. DNS resolvers (operated by Google or a local ISP) often provide users with IP addresses that are closest to them geographically. While this may appear to be a case of DNS tampering, it is actually done with the intention of providing users with faster access to websites. Similarly, false positives may emerge when tested websites serve different content depending on the country that the user is connecting from, or in the cases when websites return failures even though they are not tampered with.</p><p>Furthermore, measurements indicating HTTP or TCP/IP blocking might actually be due to temporary HTTP or TCP/IP failures, and may not conclusively be a sign of network interference. It is therefore important to test the same sets of websites across time and to cross-correlate data, prior to reaching a conclusion on whether websites are in fact being blocked.</p><p>Since block pages differ from country to country and sometimes even from network to network, it is quite challenging to accurately identify them. OONI uses a series of heuristics to try to guess if the page in question differs from the expected control, but these heuristics can often result in false positives. For this reason OONI only says that there is a confirmed instance of blocking when a block page is detected.</p><p>Upon collection of more network measurements, OONI continues to develop its data analysis heuristics, based on which it attempts to accurately identify censorship events.</p><p>The full list of country-specific test lists containing confirmed blocked websites in Myanmar, Cambodia, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam can be viewed here: <a href=https://github.com/citizenlab/test-lists>https://github.com/citizenlab/test-lists</a>.</p><h4 id=heading></h4><h4 id=confirmed-vs-heuristics>Confirmed vs Heuristics</h4><p>Confirmed OONI measurements were based on blockpages with fingerprints recorded here <a href=https://github.com/ooni/blocking-fingerprints>https://github.com/ooni/blocking-fingerprints</a>.</p><p>Hence, heuristics as below were run on raw measurements on all countries under iMAP to further confirm blockings.</p><p>Firstly, IP addresses with more than 10 domains were identified. Then each of the IP address was checked for the following:</p><p><img src=/post/2022-state-of-internet-censorship-cambodia/images/image6.png></p><p>When blocking is determined, any domain redirected to these IP addresses would be marked as ‘dns.confirmed’.</p><p>Secondly, HTTP titles and bodies were analyzed to determine blockpages. This <a href="https://explorer.ooni.org/measurement/20220411T125618Z_webconnectivity_IN_58678_n1_6zLG8ySiJHIq07Un?input=http%3A%2F%2Finfluence.in%2F">example</a> shows that the HTTP returns the text <em>‘The URL has been blocked as per the instructions of the DoT in compliance to the orders of Court of Law’</em>. Any domain redirected to these HTTP titles and bodies would be marked as ‘http.confirmed’.</p><p>As a result, false positives are eliminated and more confirmed blockings were obtained including countries like Cambodia, Vietnam and Philippines which have no confirmed blocking fingerprints on OONI.</p><p>In the case of Hong Kong, the results of the heuristics showed external censorship from outside of the country instead of local censorship. Thus, the local researchers had analysed the OONI measurements manually to identify confirmed blockings. The domains identified were based on the timed-out instances.</p><h2 id=about-imap><strong>About iMAP</strong></h2><p>Internet Monitoring Action Project (iMAP) aims to establish regional and in-country networks that monitor network interference and restrictions to the freedom of expression online in 9 countries: Myanmar, Cambodia, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam.
