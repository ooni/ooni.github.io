to remember to manually run tests? You can now have <a href=https://ooni.org/install/>OONI Probe</a> run regular censorship measurement
tests automatically for you!</p><p>In 2021, we added support for automated testing to both the <a href=https://ooni.org/install/mobile>OONI Probe mobile</a> and
<a href=https://ooni.org/install/desktop>desktop</a> apps. This means that you
can <a href=https://ooni.org/support/ooni-probe-desktop#automated-ooni-probe-testing>configure your OONI Probe app to run tests automatically</a>
on a regular basis, without having to remember to actively run the tests
yourself.</p><p>All you need to do is <strong><a href=https://ooni.org/support/ooni-probe-desktop#automated-ooni-probe-testing>enable the &ldquo;Run tests automatically&rdquo;</a></strong>
option in the &ldquo;Automated testing&rdquo; setting of your OONI Probe app.
Through these settings on OONI Probe Mobile, you can choose whether
you&rsquo;d prefer to have OONI Probe only run tests while you&rsquo;re connected to
WiFi and when your phone is charging (to avoid consuming your data and
battery).</p><p>Depending on the OONI Probe platform, automated testing currently
differs a bit. If you enable automated testing on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.openobservatory.ooniprobe">OONI Probe Android</a>,
<a href=https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id1199566366>iOS</a>, <a href=https://ooni.org/install/desktop>Windows, or macOS</a>, all tests are run
automatically every hour. If you enable automated testing on <a href=https://ooni.org/install/cli/ubuntu-debian>OONI Probe Linux</a>, automated
testing is performed every 12 hours. In all cases, the testing includes
all <a href=https://ooni.org/nettest/>tests</a> currently shipped as part of
the OONI Probe apps, excluding the performance card tests (which are
bandwidth intensive) and the new experimental card tests. Website
testing is currently limited to 100 URLs in each automated run, which
are randomly selected from the <a href=https://github.com/citizenlab/test-lists/tree/master/lists>Citizen Lab test lists</a>.</p><p>To avoid over-cluttering the &ldquo;Test Results&rdquo; section of your OONI Probe
app with too many test results (from automated runs), they are only made
available on the <a href=https://api.ooni.io/>OONI API</a> and <a href=https://explorer.ooni.org/>OONI Explorer</a>, where they are openly published
in real-time.</p><p>Since the release of OONI Probe versions with support for automated
testing, we have observed a spike in OONI measurement coverage
worldwide. Notably, we observe a spike in the number of ASNs that
receive at least 1,000 OONI measurements every month, as illustrated
below.</p><div><a href=/post/ooni-in-2021/images/02.png><img src=/post/ooni-in-2021/images/02_hub2eedd660adf8ddbfa4d1714477a5323_201596_1000x800_fit_box_2.png srcset="/post/ooni-in-2021/images/02_hub2eedd660adf8ddbfa4d1714477a5323_201596_2000x1600_fit_box_2.png 2x" title=chart alt=chart></a></div><p>The above graph demonstrates that automated OONI Probe testing has
helped ensure that a larger volume of measurements is collected from a
larger set of stable vantage points over time.</p><p>We strongly recommend <a href=https://ooni.org/support/ooni-probe-desktop#automated-ooni-probe-testing>enabling automated testing</a>,
as this will help ensure regular testing, which is crucial for detecting
censorship events. In doing so, you will contribute <a href=https://ooni.org/data/>open data</a> and help the internet freedom community
monitor and respond to censorship events around the world.</p><h2 id=new-debian-package-for-ooni-probe>New Debian package for OONI Probe</h2><div><a href=/post/ooni-in-2021/images/03.png><img src=/post/ooni-in-2021/images/03_hu322d2cfb45da7710d1345efcb7375585_72764_1000x800_fit_box_2.png srcset="/post/ooni-in-2021/images/03_hu322d2cfb45da7710d1345efcb7375585_72764_2000x1600_fit_box_2.png 2x" title="OONI Probe" alt="OONI Probe"></a></div><p>We released a <a href=https://ooni.org/install/cli/ubuntu-debian>new Debian package</a> for OONI Probe

detection tests faster.</p><p>To this end, we added a <strong>new Experimental card</strong> to the <a href=https://ooni.org/install/>OONI Probe apps</a>, where we plan to release our latest
experiments. This card is meant to provide us agility in adding and
removing new experiments on an ongoing basis, particularly in response
to emergent censorship events. By having a relatively quick and easier
way to ship new experiments, we aim to collect relevant network
measurement data that can help us improve our methodologies and respond
faster to more sophisticated forms of internet censorship.</p><p>Through the Experimental card, you can currently run our new <a href=https://github.com/ooni/spec/blob/master/nettests/ts-025-stun-reachability.md>STUN reachability test</a>.

investigated the issue and worked towards making <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.openobservatory.ooniprobe">OONI Probe Android</a>
more resilient to accidental or deliberate blocking of our backend
services.</p><p>Specifically, we implemented support for specifying a proxy that speaks
with OONI’s backend services. We also improved the build process to
influence the TLS Client Hello fingerprint, which helps with avoiding
accidental blocking.</p><p>OONI Probe Android now includes <strong>backend proxy settings</strong> where you
can:</p><ul><li><p>Enable <a href=https://psiphon.ca/>Psiphon</a>, or;</p></li><li><p>Use a custom proxy.</p></li></ul><p>This will help with circumventing any accidental or deliberate OONI

experiments which we plan to ship as part of the <a href=https://ooni.org/install/>OONI Probe apps</a> in 2022.</p><p>The new tests include:</p><ul><li><p><a href=https://github.com/ooni/probe/issues/1733>Website measurement test</a></p></li><li><p><a href=https://github.com/ooni/spec/blob/master/nettests/ts-030-torsf.md>Tor Snowflake pluggable transport test</a></p></li></ul><p>We share further information below.</p><h3 id=website-measurement-test>Website measurement test</h3><p>Currently, when you measure the blocking of websites with OONI Probe,
you run the <a href=https://ooni.org/nettest/web-connectivity/>OONI Web Connectivity test</a>. We <a href=https://ooni.org/post/web-connectivity/>released this test back in 2016</a>, when the
web was quite different. We therefore decided to re-think how we measure
websites, and to write a brand new experiment for measuring the blocking
of websites.</p><p>Our <a href=https://github.com/ooni/probe/issues/1733>new experiment</a>
(tentatively called “Websteps”) will serve as the successor to our <a href=https://github.com/ooni/spec/blob/master/nettests/ts-017-web-connectivity.md>Web Connectivity experiment</a>.
The research question that this experiment tries to address is that of
enumerating all the possible ways by which a specific URL can be
blocked. This means that this experiment does not stop when it detects
the first type of blocking, but rather drills deeper to discover all the
ways by which blocking is implemented.</p><p>The main differences compared to our current Web Connectivity test that
are worth highlighting include:</p><ul><li><p>We use a new test helper mechanism for enumerating all the endpoints
that need to be tested for a target URL. This includes all the IPs
that a particular domain resolves to, as well as the full redirect
chain from an uncensored vantage point.</p></li><li><p>We also use QUIC to measure websites.</p></li><li><p>We expand the taxonomy for classifying the various means by which
blocking is implemented.</p></li><li><p>We add support for measuring all IP:URL pairs to detect IP blocking
that only targets certain addresses.</p></li></ul><p>In writing this new test, we also made <a href=https://github.com/ooni/probe-cli/pull/528>significant improvements to our measurement engine</a>. In
particular, we implemented several new primitives for performing the
various stages of a URL request (that can eventually be reused by other
tests as well). In doing so, we also documented (in our <a href=https://github.com/ooni/probe-cli/tree/master/internal/tutorial>tutorial on writing OONI Probe tests</a>)
how third parties can go about using these functions for writing their
own tests. Once the improvements to the measurement engine were made, we
wrote the <a href=https://github.com/ooni/probe-cli/pull/530>new implementation of Websteps</a> using these new
functions.</p><p>During the summer of 2021, we had the opportunity to serve as the host
organization for <a href=https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/>Google Summer of Code (GSoC)</a> student, Kathrin
Elmenhorst, who worked with us on <a href=https://community.torproject.org/gsoc/ooni-probe-experiments/>developing OONI Probe network experiments</a>.
We worked with Kathrin on <a href=https://github.com/ooni/probe-cli/pull/432>implementing a prototype</a> for the new
Websteps experiment, <a href=https://github.com/ooni/probe-cli/pull/442>adding support for using the utls library</a> for TLS parroting,
and making <a href=https://github.com/ooni/probe/issues/1505>improvements to how errors are handled</a> inside of our
measurement engine.</p><p>Currently, you can run the new Websteps experiment through our
<a href=https://github.com/ooni/probe-cli#miniooni>miniooni researcher tool</a>. We plan to ship this
new test as part of the OONI Probe apps in 2022!</p><h3 id=tor-snowflake-pluggable-transport-test>Tor Snowflake pluggable transport test</h3><p>We developed a <a href=https://github.com/ooni/spec/blob/master/nettests/ts-030-torsf.md>new experiment</a>
for measuring the reachability of the <a href=https://snowflake.torproject.org/>Tor Snowflake pluggable transport</a>, which is used by
<a href=https://www.torproject.org/>Tor</a> users in censored environments. In
particular, Snowflake is a <a href=https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/anti-censorship/pluggable-transports/snowflake/-/wikis/home>pluggable transport</a>
that proxies traffic through temporary proxies using
<a href=https://webrtc.org/>WebRTC</a>.</p><p>Apart from developing the <a href=https://github.com/ooni/spec/blob/master/nettests/ts-030-torsf.md>new OONI Probe experiment for Tor Snowflake</a>,
we also integrated Snowflake into OONI Probe as a Go library leveraging
version 2 of the pluggable-transports specification. We <a href=https://github.com/ooni/ooni.org/issues/766>expanded our data analysis capabilities to process and annotate Snowflake measurements</a> as
“anomalous” when the test fails to successfully bootstrap the Snowflake
pluggable transport, and we <a href=https://github.com/ooni/pipeline/pull/360/files>added support for extracting the bootstrap time</a> of the Snowflake
experiment. We also <a href=https://github.com/ooni/ooni.org/issues/773>added support to OONI Explorer</a> and to the
<a href=https://github.com/ooni/ooni.org/issues/771>OONI API</a> for displaying
measurements collected from our new Snowflake experiment.</p><p>We plan to ship the new Tor Snowflake experiment as part of the OONI
Probe apps in 2022!</p><h2 id=new-tutorial-for-writing-ooni-probe-tests>New tutorial for writing OONI Probe tests</h2><p>Are you interested in contributing your own test to OONI Probe?</p><p>We published a <a href=https://github.com/ooni/probe-cli/tree/master/internal/tutorial>new tutorial</a>
which explains how to write OONI Probe tests.</p><p>This in-depth tutorial is meant for developers who are interested in
contributing new experiments to OONI Probe. The tutorial includes
multiple chapters that explain how to practically write a network
measurement experiment (using the Tor Snowflake experiment as an
example), how to use the measurex package to write network experiments,
and how to use the netxlite networking library. The tutorial includes
code based on existing network measurement experiments.</p><p>OONI Probe has always been <a href=https://github.com/ooni/>free and open source</a> to encourage independent third-party
review of our
<a href=https://github.com/ooni/spec/tree/master/nettests>methodologies</a>. We
have always hoped that the openness of OONI Probe would also encourage
talented developers to contribute new experiments.</p><p>Now, with the help of our <a href=https://github.com/ooni/probe-cli/tree/master/internal/tutorial>new tutorial</a>,
you can contribute your own network measurement tests. If integrated
into OONI Probe, your test will be run in around 200 countries and
territories every month, with test results published as <a href=https://ooni.org/data/>open data</a> in real-time.</p><p>We have already integrated the <a href=https://ooni.org/nettest/riseupvpn/>RiseupVPN test</a> developed by the LEAP
collective, and we have worked with
<a href=https://www.measurementlab.net/>M-Lab</a> on integrating the
<a href=https://ooni.org/nettest/ndt/>NDT</a> and
<a href=https://ooni.org/nettest/dash/>DASH</a> performance tests. We look
forward to integrating more tests from the community!</p><h1 id=new-ooni-tools-in-progress>New OONI tools in progress</h1><p>Throughout 2021, we worked on developing the following new OONI tools:</p><ul><li><p>OONI Probe Web</p></li><li><p>Web platform for updating test lists</p></li><li><p>Measurement Aggregation Toolkit (MAT)</p></li></ul><p>We plan to publicly launch the above tools in 2022!

your web browser. Since this does not require the installation of
software, OONI Probe Web is meant to support rapid response efforts to
emergent censorship events.</p><p>Over the years, we have received many community requests for a
browser-based version of OONI Probe that community members can easily
share, and which does not require the installation of a new app. In
response to these requests, we are building OONI Probe Web, but it will
<em>not</em> serve as a replacement for our <a href=https://ooni.org/install/>OONI Probe apps</a> because the types of tests that you
can run from a browser are very limited in comparison to what you can
technically measure through an application. As a result, OONI Probe Web
is limited to website testing (unlike the OONI Probe apps which include
a <a href=https://ooni.org/nettest/>variety of different tests</a>).</p><p>OONI Probe Web is therefore meant to <em>supplement</em> the OONI Probe apps,
to serve as a gateway for introducing more people to OONI Probe, and to
encourage more <a href=https://ooni.org/install/>OONI Probe app</a>
installations.</p><p>We have a prototype of OONI Probe Web ready, and we plan to publicly
launch it in 2022!</p><h2 id=web-platform-for-updating-test-lists>Web platform for updating test lists</h2><div><a href=/post/ooni-in-2021/images/11.png><img src=/post/ooni-in-2021/images/11_hub6967b3eb31d7e63227b708498e387f7_184917_1000x800_fit_box_2.png srcset="/post/ooni-in-2021/images/11_hub6967b3eb31d7e63227b708498e387f7_184917_2000x1600_fit_box_2.png 2x" title="web platform" alt="web platform"></a></div><p>When you measure the <a href=https://ooni.org/nettest/web-connectivity/>blocking of websites</a> with <a href=https://ooni.org/install/>OONI Probe</a>, you test websites included in the
<a href=https://github.com/citizenlab/test-lists/tree/master/lists>Citizen Lab test lists</a>.
Given that OONI Probe website testing is limited to the specific
websites included in these lists, the quality of OONI website censorship
measurement findings greatly depends on the quality of the websites
included in the Citizen Lab test lists.</p><p>These lists are publicly hosted on
<a href=https://github.com/citizenlab/test-lists/tree/master/lists>GitHub</a>,
and are curated and updated by community members around the world.
However, many community members who are best suited to determine which
websites should be tested for censorship (such as political scientists
and human rights defenders) are not GitHub users (a platform typically
used by developers), which has presented challenges in updating the
Citizen Lab test lists.</p><p>We therefore developed a <a href=https://test-lists.ooni.org/>new web platform</a> to enable community members to
review and contribute to the <a href=https://github.com/citizenlab/test-lists/tree/master/lists>Citizen Lab test lists</a>
<em>without</em> using GitHub. Through this web platform, you will be able to
review all the Citizen Lab test lists, add new URLs, propose the
deletion of URLs, and edit existing URLs and <a href=https://github.com/citizenlab/test-lists/blob/master/lists/00-LEGEND-new_category_codes.csv>category codes</a>.
You will be able to submit your contributions directly through the web
platform, which will automatically open a pull request for you on GitHub
so that community contributions can continue to go through the usual
peer-reviewed process.</p><p>We currently have a private beta version of the web platform ready,
which we’re improving upon based on community feedback. We aim to
publicly launch the platform in 2022!</p><h2 id=measurement-aggregation-toolkit>Measurement Aggregation Toolkit</h2><div><a href=/post/ooni-in-2021/images/12.png><img src=/post/ooni-in-2021/images/12_hu3ce875d9da8431028b40c9e519077765_139632_1000x800_fit_box_2.png srcset="/post/ooni-in-2021/images/12_hu3ce875d9da8431028b40c9e519077765_139632_2000x1600_fit_box_2.png 2x" title=MAT alt=MAT></a></div><p>Evaluating internet censorship requires examining measurements in
<em>aggregate</em>, which is why we are building a new <a href=https://explorer.ooni.org/experimental/mat>Measurement Aggregation Toolkit (MAT)</a>.</p><p>As part of our OONI data analysis efforts (which, for example, support
our <a href=https://ooni.org/reports/>research reports</a>), we always
aggregate measurements to evaluate whether
“<a href=https://ooni.org/support/faq/#what-do-you-mean-by-anomalies>anomalies</a>”
(signs of potential censorship) are present and, if so, whether we
observe a large volume of anomalies (on a specific network) in
comparison to successful measurements. Viewing OONI measurements in
aggregate not only helps with ruling out <a href=https://ooni.org/support/faq/#what-are-false-positives>false positives</a> and
better detecting censorship events, but it also helps with evaluating
how censorship <em>changes</em> over time, and how it <em>differs</em> across networks
in a country.</p><p>Given that data aggregation is <em>essential</em> for evaluating and detecting
censorship events, we decided to automate this process to enable the
broader internet freedom community to more effectively monitor and
respond to censorship events based on OONI data.</p><p>With our new <a href=https://explorer.ooni.org/experimental/mat>Measurement Aggregation Toolkit (MAT)</a>, you will be able to
<strong>produce custom charts based on aggregate views of real-time OONI

measurements), we are actively using our <a href=https://ooni.org/post/ooni-smart-url-list-system/>smart URL list system</a> to adjust
URL testing priorities worldwide, particularly in response to emergent
censorship events. In particular, we are actively using (and improving
upon) the <a href=https://github.com/ooni/api/blob/master/newapi/ooniapi/probe_services.py#L44>OONI check-in API</a>
to orchestrate automated OONI Probe testing (if a user has enabled
automated testing), and to ensure that probes measure URLs based on our
<a href=https://ooni.org/post/policy-url-prioritization/ooni-policy-url-prioritization.pdf>prioritization policies</a>
configured in the backend.</p><p>Based on our smart URL list system, we have prioritized the <a href=https://github.com/ooni/backend/issues/507>global testing of specific social media URLs</a> which are
<a href=https://ooni.org/reports/>frequently blocked</a> around the world. We
also prioritize the testing of the <a href=https://github.com/citizenlab/test-lists/blob/master/lists/00-LEGEND-new_category_codes.csv>Citizen Lab’s “Social Networking (GRP)” category code</a>
in specific countries in response to reports involving the blocking of
social media websites.</p><p>Our new smart URL list system has empowered us to dynamically adjust URL
testing priorities in response to censorship events. On 14th July 2021,
for example, we bumped up the priority of the <a href=https://github.com/citizenlab/test-lists/blob/master/lists/00-LEGEND-new_category_codes.csv>Citizen Lab’s “Social Networking (GRP)” category code</a>
in Cuba (in response to reports of <a href=https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/cubans-protest-government-cracks-internet-access-messaging-apps-rcna1400>social media blocks amid protests</a>).
This enabled us to detect (and collect measurements on) the <a href="https://explorer.ooni.org/search?until=2021-07-30&since=2021-06-30&probe_cc=CU&domain=www.facebook.com&only=anomalies">temporary blocking of facebook.com</a>

in Cuba (in addition to the blocking of other social media apps).
Following the prioritization of URLs from this category, we were able to
collect (and publish) a total of 960 measurements pertaining to the
testing of social media URLs in Cuba during the protests.</p><p>Throughout 2021, we made a series of improvements to the <a href=https://github.com/ooni/pipeline>OONI data processing pipeline</a>, we re-processed
all OONI measurements, we added scoring for new experiments, and we
