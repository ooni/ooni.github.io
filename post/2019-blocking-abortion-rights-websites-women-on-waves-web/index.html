countries, we analyzed <a href=https://explorer.ooni.org/>OONI measurements from around the world</a>. As part of our analysis, we also
checked whether womenonweb.org - <em>the sister organization of
womenonwaves.org</em> - is blocked around the world too.</p><p>In this report, we share OONI data confirming the blocking of
womenonwaves.org in Brazil, as well as in Iran and Turkey. We also share

inequality and have progressively changed their practices and
legislations towards the promotion of women’s rights, the protection of
sexual and reproductive rights (particularly the right to have an
abortion) remains a taboo subject. As such, in some countries, abortion
is still criminalized in complete disregard of women’s right to
self-determination, dignity, health, bodily autonomy, and, ultimately,
their right to life.</p><p>The <a href=https://reproductiverights.org/worldabortionlaws>World’s Abortion Laws Map</a> from the Center
for Reproductive Rights illustrated below shows us the status of
abortion laws around the globe.</p><p><img src=/post/2019-blocking-abortion-rights-websites-women-on-waves-web/abortion-laws-map.png alt="Map: World Abortion Laws"></p><p><strong>Source:</strong> Center for Reproductive Rights, The World’s Abotion Laws, <a href=https://reproductiverights.org/worldabortionlaws>https://reproductiverights.org/worldabortionlaws</a></p><p>In the blue countries of the map, abortion can be performed upon
request, while the laws in the green countries permit abortion under a
broad range of social and economic circumstances. The laws in the yellow
countries only permit abortion on the basis of health or therapeutic
grounds, while the laws in the red countries only allow abortion when
the woman’s life is at risk. The laws in the maroon countries do not
permit abortion under any circumstances (including when the woman’s life
or health is at risk), as abortion is strictly prohibited altogether.
There are cases in which even providing information about abortion
practices could be considered a crime.</p><p>According to the UN <a href=https://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Women/WGWomen/Pages/WGWomenIndex.aspx>Human Rights Council Working group, on the issue of discrimination against women in law and in practice</a>
the ability for a woman or girl to make her own decisions about
pregnancy <em>“is at the very core of [her] fundamental right to
equality, privacy and physical and mental integrity and is a
precondition for the enjoyment of other rights and freedoms”</em>. The group
also stressed that when the legal and safe voluntary termination of
pregnancy is not possible, <em>“unsafe abortions cause the deaths of some
47,000 women each year and a further five million suffer some form of
temporary or permanent disability.”</em></p><p>To change the legal scenario, protests and civil society pressure for
decriminalization have been common in several countries. As a result,
the United Nations Human Rights Committee released a <a href=https://www.ohchr.org/Documents/HRBodies/CCPR/CCPR_C_GC_36.pdf>General Comment on the Right to Life</a>
in 2018 which calls upon States to <em>“not apply criminal sanctions
against women and girls undergoing abortion or against medical service
providers assisting them in doing so, since taking such measures compel
women and girls to resort to unsafe abortion.”</em></p><p>Nancy Northup, the President and CEO of the Center for Reproductive
Rights, welcomed the text
<a href=https://reproductiverights.org/press-room/un-human-rights-committee-asserts-access-abortion-and-prevention-maternal-mortality-are>stating</a>
that <em>“comprehensive reproductive health services, including abortion,
are necessary to guarantee the right to life, health, privacy, and
non-discrimination for women and girls.”</em></p><p>The UN text also affirms that States should <em>“ensure access for women
and men, and, especially, girls and boys, to quality and evidence-based
information and education about sexual and reproductive health and to a
wide range of affordable contraceptive methods, and prevent the
stigmatization of women and girls seeking abortion.”</em></p><p>Alligned with the thought of such recommendations, and to support women
in countries with restricted access to safe abortion, Dutch physician
Dr. Rebecca Gomperts founded <a href=https://www.womenonwaves.org/>Women on Waves</a> in 1999. This abortion rights NGO
<a href=https://www.womenonwaves.org/en/page/650/who-are-we>aims</a> to prevent
unsafe abortions and empower women to exercise their human rights to
physical and mental autonomy. And Women on Waves does so in several
ways.</p><p>Women on Waves <a href=https://www.womenonwaves.org/en/page/2582/abortion-ship-campaigns>sails a ship to countries where abortion is illegal</a>.
On the ship &ndash; in international waters (where local laws do not apply)

information, and training. Since 2001, Women on Waves have traveled to
numerous countries to support women, including

2014, a <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vessel_(film)>documentary (“Vessel”)</a> focusing on
the work of Women on Waves was released and won numerous awards.</p><p>To provide online abortion services for women in countries where there
is no legal access to medical abortion, Dr. Rebecca Gomperts (also)
founded <a href=https://www.womenonweb.org/>Women on Web</a> in 2005. This
service provides an <a href=https://www.womenonweb.org/en/i-need-an-abortion>online consultation with a doctor</a> to support a

as well as <a href=https://www.womenonweb.org/en/page/6905/questions-and-answers>information about the abortion process</a>.
Women on Web (WoW) also publish <a href=https://www.womenonweb.org/en/page/488/i-had-an-abortion>abortion stories</a> from
women around the world. For all this work, WoW are recognized worldwide
as a source of information on sexual and reproductive rights.</p><p>As abortion remains
<a href=https://reproductiverights.org/worldabortionlaws>criminalized</a> in
several countries and Women on Waves has adopted unconventional tactics
to support safe abortions around the world, their websites
(womenonwaves.org and womenonweb.org) have been censored by certain
governments. In the following sections of this report, we share relevant
findings.</p><h1 id=blocking-of-women-on-waves-and-women-on-web>Blocking of Women on Waves and Women on Web</h1><p>Both <code>https://www.womenonwaves.org</code> and <code>https://www.womenonweb.org</code> have

presented anomalies on Telecom Egypt (AS8452) between 12th June 2019 to

limited volume of measurements and the absence of a block page (and the
fact that the measurements have been <a href="https://explorer.ooni.org/measurement/20190628T234109Z_AS8452_HMSIqGGFhQODhvEhMCUKML7uWkKJuW7FJi2lbcGsJKf1xSz1Xn?input=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.womenonweb.org%2F">successful subsequently</a>)

providing signals of potential blocking. The relatively limited volume
of measurements though &ndash; and the absence of a block page &ndash; limit our

pregnancy is the result of rape, if the life of the woman is at risk
and, after <a href=http://g1.globo.com/brasil/noticia/2012/04/supremo-decide-por-8-2-que-aborto-de-feto-sem-cerebro-nao-e-crime.html>a huge struggle of abortion rights activists</a>,
in the case of anencephaly.</p><p>Charges can result in 1 to 3 years of imprisonment for the pregnant
woman and up to 4 years for the doctor or anyone who helps out with the
abortion. Nevertheless, making it illegal has not prevented abortion
practices, but it has led women to resort to alternative and insecure
means.</p><p>According to <a href="http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S1413-81232017000200653&script=sci_abstract&tlng=pt">“Pesquisa Nacional de Aborto”</a>
(National Research on Abortion), more than half a million women in
Brazil resorted to clandestine abortion in 2016. In 2018, the Brazilian
Ministry of Health stated that such numbers could reach more than a
million. As a result (also according to data from the same Ministry),
<a href=https://www.huffpostbrasil.com/2018/08/03/uma-mulher-morre-a-cada-2-dias-por-causa-do-aborto-inseguro-diz-ministerio-da-saude_a_23495452/>usafe abortion practices accounted for the death of 203 women in 2016</a>
(which represents 1 death every two days). Over the last decade, it is

that around 2,000 women (particularly black young women who do not have

as a result of unsafe abortions.</p><p>The magazine AzMina was recently

throughout 2019. The testing of womenonwaves.org, on the other hand,
consistently presented <a href="https://explorer.ooni.org/measurement/20191014T012930Z_AS28573_OMGOO3qgceIpj8sCZTmrQa6WQVzUhpuBCP2XlT56og7cmjPpKv?input=https://www.womenonwaves.org/">TCP/IP anomalies</a>,
strongly suggesting that access to the site is blocked in Brazil.</p><p>While womenonwaves.org appears to be blocked on several networks, it’s
worth highlighting that it’s not blocked on <em>all</em> networks in Brazil, as
demonstrated in the following chart.</p><p><img src=/post/2019-blocking-abortion-rights-websites-women-on-waves-web/br-network-chart.png alt="Chart: Testing WoW across networks in Brazil"></p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href=https://explorer.ooni.org/country/BR>OONI measurements: Brazil 2018-2019</a></p><p>Most testing was performed on Claro (AS28573), where multiple
measurements consistently presented TCP/IP anomalies (since at least
January 2018), strongly suggesting that this ISP blocked access to
womenonwaves.org. Many anomalies were also detected on Telefônica Brasil
(AS27699), which is branded as Vivo, suggesting potential blocking of
womenonwaves.org on that network as well.</p><p>Data collected from the <a href=https://censoredplanet.org/projects/satellite>Satellite test</a> of <a href=https://censoredplanet.org/>Censored Planet</a> (between 1st January 2019 to 30th September
2019) suggests the DNS based blocking of <code>www.womenonwaves.org</code> in Brazil.
Satellite scans the internet for open DNS resolvers and performs queries to them
in an attempt to identify DNS based blocking. These checks are performed from
vantage points outside of the country using open DNS resolvers, which means that
the filtering observed on these resolvers may not necessarily be experienced by
users in Brazil.</p><p>Out of the 1,730 probed DNS resolvers, 4 of them (&lsquo;201.76.164.227&rsquo;,
&lsquo;200.196.48.21&rsquo;, &lsquo;189.75.28.176&rsquo;, &lsquo;128.201.60.50&rsquo;) presented signs of
interference throughout most of 2019. In particular, these resolvers respond to
queries for the domain <code>www.womenonwaves.org</code> with the following IPs:
&lsquo;200.196.48.41&rsquo; (17/17 measurements return this IP), &lsquo;192.68.2.1&rsquo; (1/1
measurement), &lsquo;200.31.1.49&rsquo; (1/35 measurements).</p><p>Overall, this is one of the few cases where we observe internet
censorship in Brazil through OONI measurements. We previously <a href=https://ooni.org/post/brazil-whatsapp-block/>reported on the blocking of WhatsApp in Brazil</a> 3 years ago, but those cases were
public, widely <a href=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/19/whatsapp-ban-brazil-facebook>discussed by the media</a>, and they only lasted a few
days. Now we observe internet censorship in Brazil targeting information
that is essential to women’s sexual and reproductive rights.</p><p>To examine the impact of the blocking, Women on Waves shared Google
analytics stats. Interestingly enough, the number of visitors to
womenonwaves.org from Brazil was 357,554 from 1st January 2019 to 25th
October 2019, down from 1,165,445 in the same period in 2016, but
slightly higher compared to 242,071 during the same period in 2018.</p><p>While <a href=https://reproductiverights.org/worldabortionlaws>most Latin American countries prohibit abortion</a> (and some

appear to censor access to abortion information, while Brazil appears to

However, it’s worth noting that these findings are limited to the
networks and the time during which womenonwaves.org was tested in each
country. That is to say that the site might potentially be blocked on
different networks where tests were not performed, or that the site
might have been blocked since the last time it was measured in each
country. Further <a href="https://run.ooni.io/nettest?tn=web_connectivity&ta=%7B%22urls%22%3A%5B%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.womenonwaves.org%2F%22%5D%7D&mv=1.2.0">OONI Probe testing of womenonwaves.org</a>

</code></pre><p>Since the URL was tested with HTTPS, we are unable to retrieve a
blockpage. The TLS handshake fails early during certificate validation
and therefore we do not retrieve the content of the tested page.</p><p>But by doing an HTTP based test using curl (even from outside of
Turkey), we are able to verify that when we pass the

are given a blockpage, as demonstrated below.</p><p><code>curl -H 'Host:www.womenonwaves.org' 213.14.227.50</code></p><pre><code>&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;meta content=&quot;text/html; charset=UTF-8&quot; http-equiv=&quot;Content-Type&quot; /&gt;&lt;meta content=&quot;matched-by-esb&quot; name=&quot;status&quot; /&gt;&lt;title&gt;Erişim Sağlayıcıları Birliği&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body bgcolor=&quot;white&quot;&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;esb&quot;&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;457803312&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;table align=&quot;center&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;100%&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;height: 100%;width: 100%;padding-top: 20px;border-bottom-width: 1px;border-bottom-style: dotted;border-bottom-color: #DDCCFE;padding-bottom: 10px;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Georgia,Times,serif;font-size:12px;line-height:140%;font-weight:normal;color:#666666;text-decoration:none;&quot;&gt;Bu internet sitesi &lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Verdana,Times,serif;font-size:12px;line-height:140%;font-weight:normal;color:#6565FF;text-decoration:none;padding-bottom:10px;&quot;&gt;(www.womenonwaves.org)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;aşağıdaki karara istinaden 5651 sayılı Kanun uyarınca Erişim Sağlayıcıları Birliği tarafından erişime engellenmiştir.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table style=&quot;align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Georgia,Times,serif;font-size:12px;line-height:140%;font-weight:normal;color:#666666;text-decoration:none;&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Georgia,Times,serif;font-size:12px;line-height:140%;font-weight:normal;color:#666666;text-decoration:none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Verdana,Times,serif;font-size:12px;line-height:140%;font-weight:normal;color:#6565FF;text-decoration:none;padding-bottom:10px;&quot;&gt;SAĞLIK BAKANLIĞI TÜRKİYE İLAÇ VE TIBBİ CİHAZ KURUMU&lt;/span&gt;'nin &lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Verdana,Times,serif;font-size:12px;line-height:140%;font-weight:normal;color:#6565FF;text-decoration:none;padding-bottom:10px;&quot;&gt;07-04-2017&lt;/span&gt; tarih ve &lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Verdana,Times,serif;font-size:12px;line-height:140%;font-weight:normal;color:#6565FF;text-decoration:none;padding-bottom:10px;&quot;&gt;61762938-000-E.78048&lt;/span&gt; sayılı kararı &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre><p>What is unclear, though, is why this type of blocking does not happen
consistently across all measurements, but only affects a very small set
of measurements.</p><p>Our findings are corroborated by <a href=/post/2019-blocking-abortion-rights-websites-women-on-waves-web/20191025-censored-planet-satellite_womenonw-eb-aves.csv.zip>Censored Planet satellite data</a>, which also shows
that the IP address 213.14.227.50 is used by the Turkish ISP to
implement blocking for <a href=http://www.womenonwaves.org>www.womenonwaves.org</a> and <a href=http://www.womenonweb.org>www.womenonweb.org</a> (as
well as for these other websites: verystream.com, openload.co,
imgur.com, streamango.com).</p><p>Google analytics (shared by Women on Web) show that 10,878 visitors from
Turkey visited womenonweb.org between 1st January 2019 to 25th October
2019, compared to 170,347visitors during the same months in 2016. Google
analytics also show that 10,942 visitors from Turkey visited
womenonwaves.org between 1st January 2019 to 25th October 2019, compared
to 141,862 visitors during the same months in 2016.</p><h1 id=censored-on-social-media-platforms>Censored on social media platforms</h1><p>Apart from the blocking of their sites in several countries, Women on
Waves and Women on Web have reportedly also experienced other forms of
censorship as well.</p><p>In May 2017, Women on Web
<a href=https://twitter.com/abortionpil/status/862935024705863680>tweeted</a>
that their Facebook page was unpublished. Facebook <a href=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/may/11/facebook-women-on-web-censored-abortion-pills>reportedly censored the Women on Web page</a>
(which helped women obtain abortion pills) citing its policy against the
“promotion or encouragement of drug use”. Their page though was only
temporarily unpublished, as <a href=https://twitter.com/abortionpil/status/862989857446035457>Facebook restored access</a> to
it soon thereafter.</p><p>This was not the first time that Women on Web experienced censorship on
Facebook. In January 2012, <a href=https://rewire.news/article/2012/01/02/facebook-censors-information-on-misoprostol/>Facebook deleted an image</a>
from the page of Dr. Rebecca Gomperts (the founder and director of Women
on Web) which consisted of text instructions on how to safely induce an
abortion using medication.</p><p>In addition to Facebook censorship, Women on Web have reportedly
experienced censorship by Twitter and YouTube as well. In January 2015,
<a href=https://www.womenonwaves.org/en/page/5343/twitter-censorship-online-abortion-service-women-on-web>Twitter temporarily disabled the possibility to link to womenonweb.org</a>
or to tweet a link to the website. In January 2018, <a href=https://www.womenonwaves.org/en/page/7044/youtube-censors-lifesaving-abortion-information>YouTube temporarily removed the video channels from Women on Waves and Women on Web</a>,
both of which contained animations with information about safe ways to
do an abortion with medicine.</p><h1 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h1><p>Our analysis of all <a href=https://explorer.ooni.org/>OONI measurements</a>
collected globally on the testing of womenonwaves.org and womeonweb.org
from 1st January 2019 onwards suggest that womeononwaves.org is blocked
in Brazil and Iran, womenonweb.org is blocked in Saudi Arabia and South
Korea, while both sites presented signs of blocking in Turkey.</p><p>Our findings are summarized in the following table.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Country</th><th>Women on Waves</th><th>Women on Web</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Brazil</td><td><a href="https://explorer.ooni.org/measurement/20191014T012930Z_AS28573_OMGOO3qgceIpj8sCZTmrQa6WQVzUhpuBCP2XlT56og7cmjPpKv?input=https://www.womenonwaves.org/">Blocked</a></td><td><a href="https://explorer.ooni.org/measurement/20191014T172125Z_AS18881_o6v9rNVUOVjVq1XBEin6micHJhv7mX3fwteIPzsToLvSMMo4d1?input=https://www.womenonweb.org/">Accessible</a></td></tr><tr><td>Iran</td><td><a href="https://explorer.ooni.org/measurement/20190916T184742Z_AS31549_01PnKsyo4c5wN5ZvzsX5UjRZqfmQnQdlHB8NklZVKjkB547xGo?input=http://www.womenonwaves.org/">Blocked</a></td><td><a href="https://explorer.ooni.org/measurement/20190904T211023Z_AS50810_5OF6OUqsPQg7dJJUbhaSBsDmwCU0k2cLg7oqyzcKsdazS4u4mO?input=https:%2F%2Fwww.womenonweb.org%2F">Accessible</a></td></tr><tr><td>Saudi Arabia</td><td><a href="https://explorer.ooni.org/measurement/20190829T121954Z_AS39891_KBC1nSlB2eqaZTrjkQO6jyCJGyoRaLykxS37CHhuV2llLYcHbV?input=https:%2F%2Fwww.womenonwaves.org%2F">Accessible</a></td><td><a href="https://explorer.ooni.org/measurement/20190904T212617Z_AS25019_Yuuq3yCL533hc63r2RV8QphzIqnNt2Ol9jeamUZ2XoaEpehUB8?input=https:%2F%2Fwww.womenonweb.org%2F">Blocked</a></td></tr><tr><td>South Korea</td><td><a href="https://explorer.ooni.org/measurement/20190904T231144Z_AS17858_1VTT4wrclVtyxlLFT1mcDVdaPKOcphUriWRSEYMkzEarObHirb?input=https:%2F%2Fwww.womenonwaves.org%2F">Accessible</a></td><td><a href="https://explorer.ooni.org/measurement/20190904T231144Z_AS17858_1VTT4wrclVtyxlLFT1mcDVdaPKOcphUriWRSEYMkzEarObHirb?input=https:%2F%2Fwww.womenonweb.org%2F">Blocked</a></td></tr><tr><td>Turkey</td><td><a href="https://explorer.ooni.org/measurement/20190612T000245Z_AS9121_XfrExgcGm0yIVI0pFbrh0qteeM1kUhKqOiVOPmACrLGWpucThG?input=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.womenonwaves.org%2F">Blocked</a></td><td><a href="https://explorer.ooni.org/measurement/20190816T114701Z_AS16135_SQpnOVp2KZ6nDAijOLF2rqqB8E7mjSzWeaaOi6D6LPWIDL9qs4?input=https:%2F%2Fwww.womenonweb.org%2F">Blocked</a></td></tr></tbody></table><p>We can confirm the <a href="https://explorer.ooni.org/measurement/20190916T184742Z_AS31549_01PnKsyo4c5wN5ZvzsX5UjRZqfmQnQdlHB8NklZVKjkB547xGo?input=http://www.womenonwaves.org/">blocking of womenonwaves.org in Iran</a>
