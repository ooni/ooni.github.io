Upon the general election in 2019, the country has been nominally a parliamentary constitutional monarchy, although with lèse-majesté laws continuing to be invoked especially with regard to internet censorship. Adding the COVID-19 pandemic into the picture, the Thai government introduced Regulation 29 to curb fake news, which led to reported incidences of internet censorship.</p><p>This report is aimed to portray the state of internet censorship in Thailand based on these reported incidents, as well as OONI measurements collected during the first half of 2022.</p><h2 id=table-of-contents>Table of Contents</h2><p><strong><a href=/post/2022-state-of-internet-censorship-thailand/#introduction>Introduction</a></strong></p><p><strong><a href=/post/2022-state-of-internet-censorship-thailand/#background>Background</a></strong></p><blockquote><p><a href=/post/2022-state-of-internet-censorship-thailand/#political-landscape>Political Landscape</a></p><blockquote><p><a href=/post/2022-state-of-internet-censorship-thailand/#legal-environment>Legal Environment</a></p></blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><p><a href=/post/2022-state-of-internet-censorship-thailand/#freedom-of-expression>Freedom of expression</a></p></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><p><a href=/post/2022-state-of-internet-censorship-thailand/#thailand-penal-code-section-112-lèse-majesté>Thailand Penal Code, Section 112

The report highlighted that 10,000 URLs were blocked in 2010, as well as 56 websites found to be blocked between May to June 2014 during the coup d’etat.</p><p>As part of the Internet Monitoring and Action Project (iMAP) which promotes and defends Internet freedoms in South and Southeast Asia, this report intends to report on the monitoring of network interference and restrictions to the freedom of expression online. This report is divided into following sections: background information on political landscape, legal environment and reported cases of internet censorship, as well as network landscape and internet penetration, followed by findings of internet censorship in Thailand, acknowledgement of limitations, conclusions and acknowledgements.</p><h2 id=background>Background</h2><p>Thailand, officially known as the Kingdom of Thailand is located at the centre of Mainland Southeast Asia with a population of more than 71 million. It is bordered to the north by Myanmar and Laos, to the east by Laos and Cambodia, to the south by the Gulf of Thailand and Malaysia, and to the west by the Andaman Sea. The country consists of 75% Thai, 14% Thai Chinese and 3% ethnically Malay. The official language is Thai, with over 90% of the population using the language daily<sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup>. Census data approximated that 93% of the population practice Buddhism, whereas a significant 5% are Muslim, and the rest are Christian (1%) and Others (&lt;1%)<sup id=fnref:2><a href=#fn:2 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>2</a></sup>. Additionally, 51% of the population live in urban areas.</p><p>Based on an <a href=https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/thailand/overview>overview by the World Bank</a>, the country has moved over the last four decades from a low-income to an upper middle-income status supported by its export-led model. Nevertheless, there was stagnation in productivity and incomes since 2015 due to domestic political turmoil, followed by the largest contraction of income during the pandemic with GDP -6.1% in 2020. In 2021, the economy grew 1.6% over the year despite experiencing another wave of COVID-19. In the same period, the latest poverty numbers were recorded at 6.8% in 2020.</p><h3 id=political-landscape>Political Landscape</h3><p>Politically, Thailand transitioned to a military-dominated semielected government in 2019 following five years of military dictatorship. The king is the head of state, whilst the head of the government is the prime minister, elected by both houses of the National Assembly. The current constitution was adopted in 2017, whereby the Parliament is bicameral, consisting of Senate and House of Representatives. The parliament could also select a candidate as Prime Minister who is not one of its members including non-politicians. Critics suggest that it effectively allows the military to control the government regardless of the outcome of subsequent elections.</p><p>According to the <a href=https://freedomhouse.org/country/thailand/freedom-world/2022>2022 Thailand Country Report by Freedom House</a>, Thailand is categorized as “Not Free” with a score of 29 over 100. The democratic deterioration and frustration led to massive demonstrations, which was followed by the regime employing authoritarian tactics, including arbitrary arrests, intimidation, lèse-majesté charges, and harassment of activists. Press freedom is constrained, due process is not guaranteed, and there is impunity for crimes committed against activists. Additionally, Thailand scored 36/100 in Internet Freedom. In 2021, the government promulgated Regulation 29, which prohibited speech that would “instigate fear.” Regulation 29 also required internet service providers to surrender the internet protocol addresses of users engaging in such speech to the authorities. A civil court blocked the regulation’s use in August, responding to a petition from activists and media outlets.</p><h3 id=legal-environment>Legal Environment</h3><h4 id=freedom-of-expression>Freedom of expression</h4><h5 id=thailand-penal-code-section-112-lèse-majesté>Thailand Penal Code, Section 112 (Lèse-majesté)</h5><p><a href=http://library.siam-legal.com/thai-law/criminal-code-royal-family-sections-107-112/>Section 112 of the Thai Penal Code</a> penalises anyone who “defames, insults or threatens the King, the Queen, the Heir-apparent or the Regent” with a punishment of imprisonment of three to fifteen years. Lèse-majesté defendants are routinely denied bail, and convictions often result in heavy sentences in most cases. Lèse-majesté or defamation complaints can be lodged by any one citizen against another, and such complaints always require formal investigation from authorities. This brings about the potential for abuse in imposing systematic restrictions of information control to limit social mobilisation around key political events.</p><h5 id=computer-crime-act>Computer Crime Act</h5><p>Article 14(1) of the <a href=http://itserv.ait.ac.th/helpdesk/announce/cc_laws_eng.pdf>2007 Computer Crime Act (CCA)</a> penalises individuals found to have uploaded content deemed to be “forged”, “false”, or which is likely to “cause damage to a third party” with an imprisonment of up to 5 years along with a maximum fine of 100,000 Thai Baht. Such broad and ambiguous language opens up the law to abuse. Article 14(1) of the CCA has long been utilised against journalists, activists and internet users for content considered to be damaging by government sanctioned authorities.</p><p>The <a href=https://thainetizen.org/docs/cybercrime-act-2017/>2017 amendment</a> to article 14(2) of the CCA broadens the scope, incriminating those found guilty of uploading information that would “damage the maintenance of national security, public safety, national economic security or public infrastructure serving national’s public interest or cause panic in the public”, and expanding the power authorities have in abusing a person’s exercise of their protected right to freedom of expression.</p><h5 id=internal-security-act-2008>Internal Security Act 2008</h5><p>Under the <a href=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Internal_Security_Act,_BE_2551_(2008)>2008 Internal Security Act</a>, the ISA would establish The Internal Security Operations Command (ISOC), a situation monitoring center in every province which would have the authority to respond to alleged threats to national security. The ISOC would be authorised to exercise its powers with respect to situations affecting the national security where a state of emergency has not been declared yet, bypassing the role of parliaments and courts in reviewing or approving the necessity of such abuses of power.</p><h4 id=press-freedom>Press freedom</h4><p>Press freedom in Thailand has been severely restricted post military coup following the military junta’s creation of the National Council for Peace and Order (NCPO) tasked with enforcing widespread censorship.</p><h5 id=ncpo-order-972014>NCPO Order 97/2014</h5><p>The NCPO announced order 97/2014, “Cooperating with the Work of the National Council for Peace and Order(NCPO) and the Distribution of News to the Public” which prohibits publication or broadcast of criticisms of the military authorities from print media, radio, TV, and online media. The NCPO has sole discretion in determining what content falls within prohibited categories. Violations of provisions in this announcement could result in prosecution under the law, and the immediate suspension of the publication or program.</p><h5 id=article-5-of-the-head-ncpo-order-32015>Article 5 of the Head NCPO Order 3/2015</h5><p>Under Article 5 of the Head NCPO Order 3/2015, NCPO officers are authorised to issue orders prohibiting the distribution of press items, or the sale of any publication or material that is deemed to have the potential to cause public alarm, or which contains false information likely to cause public misunderstanding, or which threatens public order or national security.</p><h5 id=regulation-29-regulation-issued-under-section-9-of-the-emergency-decree-on-public-administration-in-emergency-situations-be-2548-2005-no-29>Regulation 29: Regulation Issued under Section 9 of the Emergency Decree on Public Administration in Emergency Situations B.E. 2548 (2005) (No. 29)</h5><p>Under Regulation 29 it is prohibited for any person to present or disseminate content that:<sup id=fnref:3><a href=#fn:3 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>3</a></sup></p><ul><li>is distorted information which causes misunderstanding of the emergency situation to the extent of affecting the security of the state, public order, or good morals of the people of Thailand; or</li><li>may instigate fear among the people.</li></ul><p>Significantly, Regulation 29 allows the National Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission (NBTC) to identify the IP address and other information of the owner of content said to violate the regulation. It also empowers the NBTC to order Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to provide such information and to cease providing internet services for the IP address. Violation of Regulation 29 and failure by ISP providers to comply with orders issued by the NBTC both carry punishment including fines and imprisonment.</p><p>While Regulation 29 is said to be an attempt by the Thai Government to address “fake news” relating to the COVID-19 pandemic in Thailand, the regulation has been widely criticized as broadly empowering the government to control all forms of information in the public sphere, including intervention with essential media functions. This is exacerbated by the use of ambiguous language prohibiting content “that may instigate fear among the people” and which is not limited to false or distorted information.</p><h4 id=access-to-information>Access to information</h4><h5 id=official-information-act-1997>Official Information Act 1997</h5><p>The <a href=http://www.thailawforum.com/database1/official-information-act.html>1997 Official Information Act</a> gives Thai citizens the right to request for the disclosure of official government information from state agencies. However, authorities have the right to reject requests for the disclosure of information under Article 15 of the act, under unclear and overly broad reasons such as the “decline in efficiency of law enforcement, risk to national security, and endangerment of life or safety to any person”. Although citizens have the right to appeal the rejection, appeals submitted to the committee take a long time to be considered and process, making access difficult for citizens.</p><p>In addition, the Act does not cover information in the possession of private entities, which has led to <a href=https://www.article19.org/resources.php/resource/38143/en/the-right-to-information-in-thailandfor%20citizens.>ongoing disputes</a> over whether independent public agencies such as the National Anti-Corruption Commission (NACC), the Office of the Election Commission, and the Office of the Auditor General fall under the scope of the Act.</p><h4 id=privacy>Privacy</h4><h5 id=constitution-of-the-kingdom-of-thailand>Constitution of the Kingdom of Thailand</h5><p>The 2007 <a href=https://www.unodc.org/tldb/pdf/Thailand_const_2007.pdf>Constitution of the Kingdom of Thailand</a> provides citizens with the right to privacy. Under Article 35 of the constitution, “A person’s family rights, dignity, reputation or the right of privacy shall be protected.

These include websites related to human rights and news media, which significantly affect the internet freedom in the country. The number of domains reported blocked on OONI had increased from 13 to 119, possibly due to improved methodology and heightened measurements. In the list, categories which contain the more than 10 domains are Anonymization and circumvention tools, Gambling, Human Rights Issues, News Media and Pornography.</p><p>It is expected that with this study, the measurements continue to grow with wider networks and more testers.</p><h3 id=contribute-to-the-study>Contribute to the study</h3><p>There are various ways one may contribute to the OONI measurements:</p><ul><li>Testing: You may test on <a href=https://ooni.org/install/>various platforms</a>, both on Mobile (iOS and Android) and Desktop, including on the CLI on Linux platforms.

A domain is a name that is commonly attributed to websites (when they’re created), so that they can be more easily accessed and remembered. For example, twitter.com is the domain of the Twitter website. However, computers can’t connect to internet services through domain names, but based on IP addresses: the digital address of each service on the internet. Similarly, in the physical world, you would need the address of a house (rather than the name of the house itself) in order to visit it. The Domain Name System (DNS) is what is responsible for transforming a human- readable domain name (such as ooni.org) into its numerical IP address counterpart (in this case:104.198.14.52), thus allowing your computer to access the intended website.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>HTTP</strong></td><td>The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is the underlying protocol used by the World Wide Web to transfer or exchange data across the internet. The HTTP protocol allows communication between a client and a server. It does so by handling a client’s request to connect to a server, and the server’s response to the client’s request. All websites include an HTTP (or HTTPS) prefix (such as <a href=http://example.com/>http://example.com/</a>) so that your computer (the client) can request and receive the content of a website (hosted on a server). All websites include an HTTP (or HTTPS) prefix (such as <a href=http://example.com/>http://example.com/</a>) so that your computer (the client) can request and receive the content of a website (hosted on a server). The transmission of data over the HTTP protocol is unencrypted.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>ISP</strong></td><td>An Internet Service Provider (ISP) is an organization that provides services for accessing and using the internet. ISPs can be state-owned, commercial, community-owned, non-profit, or otherwise privately owned. Vodafone, AT&amp;T, Airtel, and MTN are examples of ISPs.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Middle boxes</strong></td><td>A middlebox is a computer networking device that transforms, inspects, filters, or otherwise manipulates traffic for purposes other than packet forwarding. Many Internet Service Providers (ISPs) around the world use middleboxes to improve network performance, provide users with faster access to websites, and for a number of other networking purposes. Sometimes though, middleboxes are also used to implement internet censorship and/or surveillance. The OONI Probe app includes two tests designed to measure networks with the aim of identifying the presence of middleboxes.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>TCP</strong></td><td>The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is one of the main protocols on the internet. To connect to a website, your computer needs to establish a TCP connection to the address of that website. TCP works on top of the Internet Protocol (IP), which defines how to address computers on the internet. When speaking to a machine over the TCP protocol you use an IP and port pair, which looks something like this: 10.20.1.1:8080. The main difference between TCP and (another very popular protocol called) UDP is that TCP has the notion of a “connection”, making it a “reliable” transport protocol.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>TLS</strong></td><td>Transport Layer Security (TLS) – also referred to as “SSL” – is a cryptographic protocol that allows you to maintain a secure, encrypted connection between your computer and an internet service. When you connect to a website through TLS, the address of the website will begin with HTTPS (such as <a href=https://www.facebook.com/)>https://www.facebook.com/)</a>, instead of HTTP.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>A comprehensive glossary related to OONI can be accessed here: <a href=https://ooni.org/support/glossary/>https://ooni.org/support/glossary/</a>.</p><h2 id=annex-ii-methodology>Annex II: Methodology</h2><h3 id=data>Data</h3><p>Data computed based on the heuristics for this report can be downloaded here: <a href=https://github.com/Sinar/imap-data>https://github.com/Sinar/imap-data</a> whereas aggregated data can be downloaded from <a href=https://explorer.ooni.org/>OONI Explorer</a>.</p><h3 id=coverage>Coverage</h3><p>The iMAP State of Internet Censorship Country Report covers the findings of network measurement collected through Open Observatory of Network Interference (OONI) <a href=https://ooni.org/install/>OONI Probe App</a> that measures the blocking of websites, instant messaging apps, circumvention tools and network tampering. The findings highlight the websites, instant messaging apps and circumvention tools confirmed to be blocked, the ASNs with censorship detected and method of network interference applied. The report also provides background context on the network landscape combined with the latest legal, social and political issues and events which might have an effect on the implementation of internet censorship in the country.</p><p>In terms of timeline, this first iMAP report covers measurements obtained in the six-month period from 1 January 2022 to 30 June 2022.

OONI takes measures to remove them from the collected measurements, to protect its users from <a href=https://ooni.org/about/risks/>potential risks</a>. However, there may be instances where users’ IP addresses and other potentially personally-identifiable information are unintentionally collected, if such information is included in the HTTP headers or other metadata of measurements. For example, this can occur if the tested websites include tracking technologies or custom content based on a user’s network location.</p><h4 id=network-measurements>Network measurements</h4><p>The types of network measurements that OONI collects depend on the types of tests that are run. Specifications about each OONI test can be viewed through its <a href=https://github.com/ooni/spec>git repository</a>, and details about what collected network measurements entail can be viewed through <a href=https://explorer.ooni.org/world/>OONI Explorer</a> or through <a href=https://api.ooni.io/>OONI’s measurement API</a>.</p><p>In order to derive meaning from the measurements collected, OONI processes the data types mentioned above to answer the following questions:</p><ul><li>Which types of OONI tests were run?</li><li>In which countries were those tests run?</li><li>In which networks were those tests run?</li><li>When were tests run?</li><li>What types of network interference occurred?</li><li>In which countries did network interference occur?</li><li>In which networks did network interference occur?</li><li>When did network interference occur?</li><li>How did network interference occur?</li></ul><p>To answer such questions, OONI’s pipeline is designed to answer such questions by processing network measurements data to enable the following:</p><ul><li>Attributing measurements to a specific country.</li><li>Attributing measurements to a specific network within a country.</li><li>Distinguishing measurements based on the specific tests that were run for their collection.</li><li>Distinguishing between “normal” and “anomalous” measurements (the latter indicating that a form of network tampering is likely present).</li><li>Identifying the type of network interference based on a set of heuristics for DNS tampering, TCP/IP blocking, and HTTP blocking.</li><li>Identifying block pages based on a set of heuristics for HTTP blocking.</li><li>Identifying the presence of “middle boxes” within tested networks.</li></ul><p>According to OONI, false positives may occur within the processed data due to a number of reasons. DNS resolvers (operated by Google or a local ISP) often provide users with IP addresses that are closest to them geographically. While this may appear to be a case of DNS tampering, it is actually done with the intention of providing users with faster access to websites. Similarly, false positives may emerge when tested websites serve different content depending on the country that the user is connecting from, or in the cases when websites return failures even though they are not tampered with.</p><p>Furthermore, measurements indicating HTTP or TCP/IP blocking might actually be due to temporary HTTP or TCP/IP failures, and may not conclusively be a sign of network interference. It is therefore important to test the same sets of websites across time and to cross-correlate data, prior to reaching a conclusion on whether websites are in fact being blocked.</p><p>Since block pages differ from country to country and sometimes even from network to network, it is quite challenging to accurately identify them. OONI uses a series of heuristics to try to guess if the page in question differs from the expected control, but these heuristics can often result in false positives. For this reason OONI only says that there is a confirmed instance of blocking when a block page is detected.</p><p>Upon collection of more network measurements, OONI continues to develop its data analysis heuristics, based on which it attempts to accurately identify censorship events.</p><p>The full list of country-specific test lists containing confirmed blocked websites in Myanmar, Cambodia, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam can be viewed here: <a href=https://github.com/citizenlab/test-lists>https://github.com/citizenlab/test-lists</a>.</p><h4 id=confirmed-vs-heuristics>Confirmed vs Heuristics</h4><p>Confirmed OONI measurements were based on blockpages with fingerprints recorded here <a href=https://github.com/ooni/blocking-fingerprints>https://github.com/ooni/blocking-fingerprints</a>.</p><p>Hence, heuristics as below were run on raw measurements on all countries under iMAP to further confirm blockings.</p><p>Firstly, IP addresses with more than 10 domains were identified. Then each of the IP address was checked for the following:</p><p><img src=/post/2022-state-of-internet-censorship-thailand/images/image25.png></p><p>When blocking is determined, any domain redirected to these IP addresses would be marked as ‘dns.confirmed’.</p><p>Secondly, HTTP titles and bodies were analysed to determine blockpages. This <a href="https://explorer.ooni.org/measurement/20220411T125618Z_webconnectivity_IN_58678_n1_6zLG8ySiJHIq07Un?input=http%3A%2F%2Finfluence.in%2F">example</a> shows that the HTTP returns the text ‘The URL has been blocked as per the instructions of the DoT in compliance to the orders of Court of Law’. Any domain redirected to these HTTP titles and bodies would be marked as ‘http.confirmed’.</p><p>As a result, false positives are eliminated and more confirmed blockings were obtained including countries like Cambodia, Vietnam and Philippines which have no confirmed blocking fingerprints on OONI.</p><p>In the case of Hong Kong, the results of the heuristics showed external censorship from outside of the country instead of local censorship. Thus, the local researchers had analysed the OONI measurements manually to identify confirmed blockings. The domains identified were based on the timed-out instances.</p><hr><h2 id=about-imap>About iMAP</h2><p>Internet Monitoring Action Project (iMAP) aims to establish regional and in-country networks that monitor network interference and restrictions to the freedom of expression online in 9 countries: Myanmar, Cambodia, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam.
