starting on the eve of the election (13th January 2021) and ending in
the morning of 18th January 2021. In the days leading up to the

Multiparty elections have been
<a href=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4750040.stm>held</a> in the country
since 2006, but President Museveni (and his <a href=https://www.nrm.ug/>National Resistance Movement</a> party) has <a href=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-55689665>won every election</a> over the last
35 years (even though past elections have been marred by <a href=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/2/19/rigging-claims-and-arrest-mar-voting-in-uganda>allegations of rigging</a>).</p><p>During Uganda’s <a href=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-35522675>2016 general election</a>, access to
major social media platforms was
<a href=https://ooni.org/post/uganda-social-media-blocked/>blocked</a> both
amid the election (in February 2016) and leading up to President
Museveni’s (fifth) inauguration (in May 2016). At the time, authorities
<a href=https://www.facebook.com/MTNUG/posts/1406632952696281>justified</a> the
blocking of social media on the grounds of security, though this
<a href=https://advox.globalvoices.org/2016/05/11/social-media-blocked-in-uganda-ahead-of-president-musevenis-inauguration/>reportedly</a>
harmed the political opposition which relied on social media platforms
to organize protests.</p><p>Two years later (in July 2018), Uganda
<a href=https://cipesa.org/2018/07/uganda-blocks-access-to-social-media-vpns-and-dating-sites-as-new-tax-takes-effect/>introduced</a>
the Over the Top (OTT) tax &ndash; commonly referred to as the “<a href=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-44798627>Social Media Tax</a>” &ndash; which
requires internet users in Uganda to pay taxes to the government in
order to access a <a href=https://www.mtn.co.ug/product/ott-tax/>wide range of online social media platforms</a> (such as WhatsApp,
Facebook, Twitter, Viber, Google Hangouts, Snapchat, Skype, and
Instagram, among many others). To access such platforms, users of
Ugandan Internet Service Providers (ISPs) are required to pay <a href=https://www.mtn.co.ug/product/ott-tax/>UGX 200 (USD 0.05) per day</a>, which has
<a href=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/feb/27/millions-of-ugandans-quit-internet-after-introduction-of-social-media-tax-free-speech>reportedly</a>
led to millions of people in Uganda abandoning online social media due
to affordability constraints.</p><p>According to President Museveni, this social media tax is
<a href=https://www.yowerikmuseveni.com/why-government-taxing-social-media-president-museveni>meant</a>
to reduce capital flight and improve Uganda’s tax to GDP ratio. However,
previous <a href="https://cipesa.org/?wpfb_dl=252">studies</a> in the region have
shown that restricting internet access (through internet disruptions)
and increasing the cost of internet access have the potential to impact
Uganda’s economic growth.</p><p>To limit untaxed access to social media, Ugandan ISPs have also
<a href=https://ooni.org/post/uganda-social-media-tax/#blocking-of-circumvention-tools>blocked</a>
access to a number of circumvention tools as well. In 2018, we published
a <a href=https://ooni.org/post/uganda-social-media-tax/>research report</a>
which documented the blocking of online social media and censorship
circumvention platforms in Uganda (when the OTT tax was not paid)
through the analysis of OONI network measurement data.</p><p>Over the last 2.5 years, people in Uganda had access to major social
media platforms if they paid the <a href=https://www.mtn.co.ug/product/ott-tax/>OTT tax</a>. But this changed in the
week leading up to Uganda’s latest (2021) <a href=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-55573581>general election</a> (held on 14th
January 2021), when Ugandans
<a href=https://twitter.com/cipesaug/status/1347789536521293826>reported</a>
that they were unable to download apps from the Google Play Store. In
the days that followed, locals also
<a href=https://twitter.com/UnwantedWitness/status/1348842353973407744>reported</a>
that they were unable to access major social media platforms (such as
Facebook) &ndash; even once they had paid the OTT tax.</p><p>On 12th January 2021, Ugandan ISPs
<a href=https://www.facebook.com/MTNUG/posts/5644233898936144>confirmed</a> the
blocking of online social media platforms and online messaging
applications in compliance with a directive from the UCC.</p><div><a href=/post/2021-uganda-general-election-blocks-and-outage/images/MTN.jpeg><img src=/post/2021-uganda-general-election-blocks-and-outage/images/MTN_hu17698951907267083898.jpeg title="MTN notice" alt="MTN notice"></a></div><p>The recent blocking of social media <a href=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-55640405>reportedly followed Facebook’s closure of “fake” accounts</a> which it said
were linked to Uganda’s government and used to boost the popularity of
posts. This move was <a href=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-55640405>seen as a form of retaliation</a> as (on
12th January 2021) President Museveni <a href=https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/13/world/africa/uganda-facebook-ban-elections.html>accused Facebook of “arrogance”</a>
for determining which accounts are fake and interfering with the
election; he stated that he had therefore instructed the blocking of
Facebook and other social media platforms. To limit censorship
circumvention, the Uganda Communications Commission (UCC)
<a href=https://www.ugstandard.com/ucc-lists-over-100-vpns-directs-internet-service-providers-to-block-them/>reportedly</a>
ordered the blocking of more than 100 VPNs.</p><p>On the eve of <a href=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-55573581>Uganda’s 2021 general election</a>, the UCC
ordered the suspension of the operation of all internet gateways and
associated access points in Uganda. The order specified that this
suspension should take effect at 7pm on 13th January 2021, as
illustrated below.</p><div><a href=/post/2021-uganda-general-election-blocks-and-outage/images/UCC.jpeg><img src=/post/2021-uganda-general-election-blocks-and-outage/images/UCC_hu11362723613082042922.jpeg title="UCC notice" alt="UCC notice"></a></div><p>Overall, the run-up to <a href=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-55573581>Uganda’s 2021 general election</a> was marred by
violence, as authorities
<a href=https://time.com/5929196/uganda-elections-bobi-wine-museveni/>reportedly</a>
cracked down on opposition rallies, while opposition candidates and
their supporters experienced threats and intimidation over the last
months. President Museveni’s re-election was primarily challenged by
<a href=https://www.dw.com/en/bobi-wine-from-pop-star-to-presidential-hopeful-in-uganda/a-56104080>Bobi Wine</a>
(one of 10 candidates challenging President Museveni in the 2021 general
election), a 38-year-old pop star who emerged as a prominent member of
Uganda’s political opposition in 2017 and ran for Uganda’s presidency in
the latest election. However, Mr. Museveni was
<a href=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-55689665>re-elected</a>, winning
almost 59% of the vote and a sixth presidential term (despite
accusations of vote fraud by the opposition).</p><h1 id=methods>Methods</h1><p>To investigate the blocking of online platforms, we analyzed <a href="https://explorer.ooni.org/search?until=2021-01-20&since=2020-12-21&probe_cc=UG">OONI measurements collected from Uganda</a>
(similarly to our <a href=https://ooni.org/post/uganda-social-media-tax/>2018 study</a> examining the
blocking of social media and circumvention tools with the introduction
of the OTT tax). OONI measurements are regularly collected and
contributed by users of the <a href=https://ooni.org/install/>OONI Probe app</a>, which is <a href=https://github.com/ooni>free and open source</a>, designed to
<a href=https://ooni.org/nettest/>measure</a> various forms of internet
censorship and network interference.</p><p>More specifically, we limited our analysis to OONI measurements
collected from Uganda between <strong>9th January 2021 to 19th January 2021</strong>,
as network disruptions were first
<a href=https://twitter.com/cipesaug/status/1347789536521293826>reported</a> on
9th January 2021, while internet connectivity was
<a href="https://ioda.caida.org/ioda/dashboard#view=inspect&entity=country/UG&lastView=overview&from=-1w&until=now">restored</a>
in the country by 18th January 2021. We further limited our analysis to
OONI measurements pertaining to the testing of social media websites and
apps, as well as to the testing of circumvention tool websites and apps.</p><p>While a wide range of social media and circumvention tool websites can
be tested through OONI’s <a href=https://ooni.org/nettest/web-connectivity/>Web Connectivity test</a> (designed to measure
the TCP/IP, DNS, and HTTP blocking of websites), the <a href=https://ooni.org/install/>OONI Probe app</a> currently only includes tests for the
following social media apps:
<a href=https://ooni.org/nettest/whatsapp/>WhatsApp</a>, <a href=https://ooni.org/nettest/facebook-messenger/>Facebook Messenger</a>, and
<a href=https://ooni.org/nettest/telegram/>Telegram</a>. Quite similarly, the
OONI Probe app currently only includes tests for the following
circumvention tools: <a href=https://ooni.org/nettest/tor/>Tor</a> and
<a href=https://ooni.org/nettest/psiphon/>Psiphon</a>. Our analysis was
therefore limited to the testing of these specific apps.</p><p>Our findings are also limited by the type and volume of measurements
contributed by volunteer OONI Probe users in Uganda (i.e. if a blocked
service was not tested in Uganda in the analysis period, relevant
measurement findings will not be available). Prior to 12th January 2021,
there was a divergence of
<a href="https://explorer.ooni.org/search?until=2021-01-20&since=2020-12-21&probe_cc=UG">measurements</a>
from probes run by users who had and had not paid the <a href=https://www.mtn.co.ug/product/ott-tax/>OTT tax</a>. After 12th January 2021,
we observed the disappearance of that divergence as users who had paid
OTT tax experienced the blocks previously instituted on ones who had not
paid the tax, as well as new blockages imposed on all users.</p><p>To investigate the blocking of circumvention tools further, we also ran
a series of experiments (with the help of volunteers in Uganda) through
the <code>miniooni</code> research client. We ran these experiments to
characterize TLS blocking patterns. As test cases, we selected the Play
Store’s website, ProtonVPN’s website, and Facebook’s website. We checked
whether their blocking depended on DNS, TCP, or TLS blocking. In the
case of TLS blocking, we further investigated whether it depended on the
value of the SNI extension.</p><p>To explore Uganda’s internet blackout (when access to the internet was
disrupted entirely), we referred to the following public data sources:
<a href="https://ioda.caida.org/ioda/dashboard#view=inspect&entity=country/UG&lastView=overview&from=-1w&until=now">Internet Outage Detection and Analysis (IODA)</a>,
<a href="https://transparencyreport.google.com/traffic/overview?hl=en&fraction_traffic=start:1610064000000;end:1611100799999;product:19;region:UG&lu=fraction_traffic">Google traffic data</a>,
<a href="https://map.internetintel.oracle.com/?root=national&country=UG">Oracle’s Internet Intelligence Map</a>,
and <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/ug?date_filter=last_7_days">Cloudflare Radar</a> data.
Our goal was to check whether the signals and timing of Uganda’s
internet blackout can be verified and corroborated by all four separate
public data sources, and how they can compare to the UCC order (which
<a href=https://blog.cloudflare.com/uganda-january-13-2021-internet-shut-down/>instructed</a>
the suspension of internet gateways and associated access points at 7pm
on 13th January 2021).</p><h1 id=blocks-in-the-election-run-up>Blocks in the election run-up</h1><h2 id=app-stores>App Stores</h2><p>On 9th January 2021, people in Uganda <a href=https://twitter.com/cipesaug/status/1347789536521293826>started reporting</a>
that they experienced difficulties downloading apps from the Google Play
Store. This appears to be corroborated by <a href="https://explorer.ooni.org/search?until=2021-01-19&since=2021-01-01&probe_cc=UG&domain=play.google.com">OONI measurements</a>,
which show that the testing of <code>google.play.com</code> <a href="https://explorer.ooni.org/measurement/20210118T114745Z_webconnectivity_UG_20294_n1_twQcpdotSk0kBhOW?input=https%3A%2F%2Fplay.google.com%2Fstore%2F">presented signs of blocking</a>
on several networks almost every time that it was tested between 10th
January 2021 to 18th January 2021 (the relevant URL was not tested in
Uganda on 9th January 2021).</p><p>While we also heard reports of potential Apple App Store blocking too,
we cannot confirm this based on OONI measurements, which show that
<code>apps.apple.com</code> was

which shows that the levels of YouTube traffic originating from Uganda
are significantly decreased in comparison to the pre-internet blackout
levels, as illustrated below.</p><div><a href=/post/2021-uganda-general-election-blocks-and-outage/images/youtube-google-traffic.png><img src=/post/2021-uganda-general-election-blocks-and-outage/images/youtube-google-traffic_hu983481952778916382.png title="Google traffic for YouTube" alt="Google traffic for YouTube"></a></div><p><strong>Source:</strong> Google Transparency Reports, Traffic and disruptions to

users received from their ISPs on 18th January 2021, which explicitly
lists YouTube among the blocked internet services (in compliance with a
UCC directive).</p><div><a href=/post/2021-uganda-general-election-blocks-and-outage/images/youtube-blocking-notice.jpeg><img src=/post/2021-uganda-general-election-blocks-and-outage/images/youtube-blocking-notice_hu9883573807860457918.jpeg title="YouTube blocking notice" alt="YouTube blocking notice"></a></div><p>It is possible that this move may be in response to government orders to
censor specific YouTube channels affiliated with the political
opposition. Following deadly riots in November 2019 over the arrest of
opposition presidential candidate (Bobi Wine), it was
<a href=https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/entertainment/showbiz/2001397460/uganda-writes-to-google-wants-channel-affiliated-with-bobi-wine-closed>reported</a>
in December 2019 that the UCC wrote to Google requesting that over 14
YouTube channels be shut down for allegedly mobiling the riots. The UCC
<a href=https://www.africanews.com/2020/12/16/uganda-seeks-to-block-14-youtube-channels-over-deadly-protests//>claimed</a>
that these YouTube channels spread misinformation, fueled riots, and
undermined public interest. Possibly as a result of non-compliance on
Google’s end, the Ugandan government may have resorted to blocking
YouTube itself. Given that YouTube is hosted on encrypted HTTPS, ISPs
cannot limit the blocking to specific channels, but rather need to block
the whole of <code>www.youtube.com</code>.</p><p>It’s worth noting that in all the above social media cases, we observe
the same <a href="https://explorer.ooni.org/measurement/20210119T133832Z_webconnectivity_UG_36991_n1_GgUkoG1Q31G3COkQ?input=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2F">HTTP failures</a>
and <code>connection reset</code> errors in OONI measurements, increasing our
confidence with respect to their blocking because ISPs often block
websites through the use of the same techniques. This is also consistent
with our <a href=https://ooni.org/post/uganda-social-media-tax/>measurement findings in our 2018 study</a> in Uganda. The
following sections (“Characterizing website blocking”) dive into this
deeper, as we investigated some of the blocked websites through the use
of more advanced techniques (which we haven’t integrated into the <a href=https://ooni.org/install/>OONI Probe apps</a> yet).</p><h3 id=apps>Apps</h3><p>To examine the blocking of social media apps, we analyzed OONI data

and that HTTP(S) GET requests to <code>web.telegram.org</code> do not send back a
consistent response to OONI servers. As these patterns (for WhatsApp,
Facebook Messenger, and Telegram) are quite consistent across many
measurements and networks throughout the same time periods, they provide
strong signals of potential blocking.</p><h2 id=circumvention-tools>Circumvention tools</h2><p>To limit censorship circumvention, the Uganda Communications Commission
(UCC)
<a href=https://www.ugstandard.com/ucc-lists-over-100-vpns-directs-internet-service-providers-to-block-them/>reportedly</a>
ordered the blocking of more than 100 VPNs in the days leading up to the

<em>not</em> observe any significant signs of blocking, as most measurements
(collected from multiple networks in Uganda) showed that the tools
worked as expected. This is illustrated through the following chart,

We conclude that there was evidence of SNI based blocking for both
<code>facebook.com</code> and <code>www.facebook.com</code>. We also note that
<code>https://example.com</code> has not always been reliably reachable during
the testing period.</p><p>Interestingly, we could not access Facebook&rsquo;s website using the QUIC

By inspecting the <code>network_events</code> key of these measurements, we
notice that the code calls <code>sendto</code> several times (<code>sendto</code> is
called <code>write_to</code> in <code>network_events</code>). Each time, it writes the
initial message containing the ClientHello. Because there is no reply,
the message is transmitted several times. Eventually, the client times
out.</p><p>We repeated each experiment using <code>example.com</code> as the SNI (see, e.g.,

The behavior of the QUIC client is the same as before. It calls
<code>sendto</code> several times, and then eventually it times out. We conclude
that these Facebook QUIC endpoints are likely blocked.</p><h3 id=airtel-1>Airtel</h3><p>We recorded nine failures and four successes. The successes all occurred

All these measurements failed after the QUIC handshake completed. The
client and the server exchange some extra data after the handshake, then
the client times out reading or writing. When it times out writing, it
retransmits several times before giving up. When it times out reading,
it just blocks until there is no network activity for several seconds.</p><div><a href=/post/2021-uganda-general-election-blocks-and-outage/images/facebook-airtel-quic.png><img src=/post/2021-uganda-general-election-blocks-and-outage/images/facebook-airtel-quic_hu3717983317451881236.png title="Facebook measurements from Airtel (using QUIC)" alt="Facebook measurements from Airtel (using QUIC)"></a></div><p><strong>Figure:</strong> Facebook measurements from Airtel (using QUIC)</p><p>We retried using <code>example.com</code> as the SNI.

allowing us to drill-in deeper and examine which networks were affected
by the internet outage in Uganda. Analyzing network-level data also
allows us to examine if there were differences in the times at which the

large drop in BGP-visible /24 blocks for RENU (AS327687) and Tangerine

However, Infocom (AS36997) and Roke (AS37063) do not see any drop in

experienced an outage on 12th January 2021 at around 22:00. These
outages could perhaps be due to potential tests that network operators
may have performed in anticipation of the government order to suspend

the necessity and proportionality of these restrictions remain quite
