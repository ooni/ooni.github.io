Her family was told that she would be released after a “re-education session”, but she died in custody three days later.</p><p>Witnesses <a href=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/17/iran-protests-death-kurdish-woman-mahsaa-amini-morality-police>reported</a> that Amini was beaten in the detention van, but the police <a href=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-62994003>deny</a> this allegation, maintaining that she suffered “sudden heart failure”. Her family said that she was fit and healthy, and her father <a href=https://edition.cnn.com/2022/09/22/middleeast/iran-protests-mahsa-amini-father-internet-blackout-intl-hnk/index.html>reported</a> that the authorities lied about his daughter’s death.</p><p>Amini’s death sparked <a href=https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/22/world/middleeast/iran-protests.html>widespread protests</a> in multiple cities in Iran. The ongoing protests have been <a href=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-62994003>described</a> as the most serious challenge to the Islamic leadership of Iran in recent years. Authorities have cracked down on the protests, which have <a href=https://iranhr.net/fa/articles/5496/>reportedly</a> resulted in at least 31 civilian deaths, including a 16-year-old boy who was <a href=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-62986057>shot dead</a> when security forces opened fire at protesters.</p><p>As the protests intensified, Iranian authorities <a href=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/22/iran-blocks-capitals-internet-access-as-amini-protests-grow>cracked down on internet access</a> in an attempt to curb dissent. Over the past week, multiple <a href=https://github.com/net4people/bbs/issues/125>outages affecting mobile networks</a> in Iran were <a href=https://twitter.com/maasalan/status/1571914473753149442>reported</a>, which are also visible in the <a href="https://ioda.inetintel.cc.gatech.edu/country/IR?from=1663279200&until=1663970399">IODA</a>, <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/asn/44244?date_filter=last_7_days">Cloudflare Radar</a> and <a href=https://twitter.com/DougMadory/status/1573309958791241728>Kentik</a> datasets. Beyond mobile network outages, Iran also ramped up its internet censorship. We <a href=https://twitter.com/OpenObservatory/status/1572548266587475968>reported</a> that as of 20th September 2022, OONI data started to show that Iran intensified the blocking of encrypted DNS services. On 21st September 2022, OONI data started to show the blocking of <a href="https://explorer.ooni.org/chart/mat?probe_cc=IR&test_name=whatsapp&since=2022-08-24&until=2022-09-24&axis_x=measurement_start_day">WhatsApp</a> and <a href="https://explorer.ooni.org/chart/mat?probe_cc=IR&test_name=web_connectivity&domain=www.instagram.com&since=2022-08-24&until=2022-09-24&axis_x=measurement_start_day">Instagram</a> in Iran as well (we dive into these – and other – cases in the Findings section below).</p><p>The latest censorship events follow a pattern where Iran restricts internet access during protests and unrest. Iran previously experienced a <a href=https://ooni.org/post/2019-iran-internet-blackout/>nation-wide internet blackout</a> during the <a href=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/11/20/irans-protests-all-you-need-to-know-in-600-words/>November 2019 protests</a>. During the blackout, most Iranians were barred from connecting to the global Internet, but they still had <a href=https://ooni.org/post/2019-iran-internet-blackout/#irans-intranet>access to Iran’s national intranet</a> (the domestic network hosting Iranian websites and services). Amid major <a href=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/02/iran-protests-how-did-they-start-and-where-are-they-heading>anti-government protests</a> between late December 2017 to early January 2018, Iran <a href=https://ooni.org/post/2018-iran-protests/>blocked</a> access to Telegram, Instagram, and Facebook Messenger.</p><p>While Iran has intensified its internet restrictions in recent days, it’s important to highlight that major social media platforms are not only blocked during protests. Iran has <a href=https://ooni.org/post/iran-internet-censorship/>pervasive levels of internet censorship</a>, as many different types of websites (including <a href="https://explorer.ooni.org/chart/mat?probe_cc=IR&test_name=web_connectivity&category_code=HUMR&since=2022-08-25&until=2022-09-25&axis_x=measurement_start_day">human rights</a> and <a href="https://explorer.ooni.org/chart/mat?probe_cc=IR&test_name=web_connectivity&category_code=NEWS&since=2022-08-25&until=2022-09-25&axis_x=measurement_start_day">news media</a> websites) and apps (such as <a href="https://explorer.ooni.org/chart/mat?probe_cc=IR&test_name=telegram&since=2022-01-25&until=2022-09-25&axis_x=measurement_start_day">Telegram</a>) have been blocked in the country for years. In January 2021, Iran also started <a href=https://ooni.org/post/2021-how-signal-private-messenger-blocked-around-the-world/#iran>blocking access to the Signal Private Messenger app</a>, while in 2020 we found that Iran was <a href=https://ooni.org/post/2020-iran-dot/>blocking DNS over TLS (DoT)</a>. In addition to government mandated internet censorship implemented by Iranian Internet Service Providers (ISPs), Iranians have also <a href=https://censoredplanet.org/assets/403forbidden.pdf>experienced server-side blocking</a> as a result of U.S sanctions. But notably, on 23rd September 2022, the U.S Treasury <a href=https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0974>issued</a> an <a href=https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/126/iran_gld2.pdf>Iran General License D-2</a> to broaden the scope of software and services that U.S. companies are allowed to offer to Iranian users. \</p><p>In the following sections of this report, we share <a href=https://ooni.org/data>OONI data</a> on new blocks that emerged in Iran over the past week amid the ongoing protests.</p><h2 id=methods>Methods</h2><p>Since 2012, OONI has developed free and open source software (called <a href=https://ooni.org/install/>OONI Probe</a>) which is designed to <a href=https://ooni.org/nettest/>measure various forms of internet censorship</a>, including the blocking of websites and apps. Every month, OONI Probe is regularly run by volunteers in <a href=https://explorer.ooni.org/>around 170 countries</a> (including <a href=https://explorer.ooni.org/country/IR>Iran</a>), and network measurements collected by OONI Probe users are automatically published as <a href=https://ooni.org/data>open data in real-time</a>.</p><p>As part of this study, we looked at measurements collected from OONI’s <a href=https://ooni.org/nettest/web-connectivity/>Web Connectivity</a> and <a href=https://ooni.org/nettest/whatsapp/>WhatsApp</a> tests in Iran over the past week (from 16th September 2022 onwards). While OONI Probe includes a variety of different <a href=https://github.com/ooni/spec/tree/master/nettests>network measurement experiments</a>, we narrowed our focus to these two specific tests because they measure the accessibility of services that were reportedly blocked in recent days (other apps, like <a href="https://explorer.ooni.org/chart/mat?probe_cc=IR&test_name=signal&since=2021-09-25&until=2022-09-25&axis_x=measurement_start_day">Signal</a> and <a href="https://explorer.ooni.org/chart/mat?probe_cc=IR&test_name=facebook_messenger&since=2021-09-25&until=2022-09-25&axis_x=measurement_start_day">Facebook Messenger</a>, had already been blocked over the past year).</p><p>OONI’s <a href=https://ooni.org/nettest/whatsapp/>WhatsApp test</a> is designed to measure the reachability of both WhatsApp’s app and the WhatsApp web version (<code>web.whatsapp.com</code>) within a tested network. Specifically, the test attempts to perform an HTTP GET request, TCP connection and DNS lookup to WhatsApp’s endpoints, registration service and web version over the vantage point of the user. Based on our methodology, we automatically annotate WhatsApp measurements as “successful” if the test succeeds in performing these steps.</p><p>If, however, any of the following occur, WhatsApp measurements are automatically annotated as “<a href=https://ooni.org/support/faq#what-do-you-mean-by-anomalies>anomalies</a>”:</p><ul><li>TCP connections to WhatsApp’s endpoints, registration service, or web.whatsapp.com fail;</li><li>DNS lookups resolve to IP addresses that are not allocated to WhatsApp;</li><li>HTTP requests to WhatsApp’s registration service or <code>web.whatsapp.com</code> do not send back a consistent response to OONI’s servers.</li></ul><p><a href=https://ooni.org/support/faq#what-do-you-mean-by-anomalies>Anomalous measurements</a> may be indicative of blocking, but <a href=https://ooni.org/support/faq#what-are-false-positives>false positives</a> can occur. We therefore consider that the likelihood of blocking is greater if the overall volume of anomalous WhatsApp measurements is high in comparison to the overall WhatsApp measurement count (compared on an ASN level within the same date range). We further disaggregate based on the reasons that caused the anomaly (e.g. TCP connection failures towards a set of WhatsApp endpoints) and if they are consistent, they provide a stronger signal of potential blocking.</p><p>OONI’s <a href=https://ooni.org/nettest/web-connectivity/>Web Connectivity test</a>, on the other hand, is designed to measure the accessibility of URLs by performing the following steps:</p><ul><li>Resolver identification</li><li>DNS lookup</li><li>TCP connect to the resolved IP addresses</li><li>TLS handshake to the resolved IP addresses</li><li>HTTP(s) GET request following redirects</li></ul><p>The above steps are automatically performed from both the local network of the user, and from a control vantage point. If the results from both networks are the same, the tested URL is annotated as accessible. If the results differ, the tested URL is annotated as <a href=https://ooni.org/support/faq#what-do-you-mean-by-anomalies>anomalous</a>, and the type of anomaly is further characterized depending on the reason that caused the failure (for example, if the TCP connection fails, the measurement is annotated as a TCP/IP anomaly).</p><p>Each <a href=https://ooni.org/nettest/web-connectivity/>Web Connectivity</a> measurement provides further network information (such as information pertaining to TLS handshakes) that helps with evaluating whether an anomalous measurement presents signs of blocking (or is a <a href=https://ooni.org/support/faq#what-are-false-positives>false positive</a>). Based on our heuristics, we are able to automatically confirm the blocking of websites if a <a href=https://ooni.org/support/glossary#block-page>block page</a> is served, or if DNS resolution returns an IP known to be associated with censorship (and such fingerprints have been added to our database).</p><p>Over the past years, Iranian ISPs have blocked websites by serving block pages and by returning IPs associated with censorship (which, for example, used to host block pages). By adding such fingerprints to our database, we have been able to <a href="https://explorer.ooni.org/search?since=2022-08-25&until=2022-09-25&failure=false&probe_cc=IR&only=confirmed">automatically confirm the blocking of numerous websites in Iran</a>. Moreover, the overall OONI measurement coverage in Iran is relatively <a href=https://explorer.ooni.org/country/IR>high</a> (in <a href=https://explorer.ooni.org/countries>comparison</a> to many other countries), increasing our confidence in our findings.</p><h2 id=findings>Findings</h2><p>As of 20th September 2022 (amid <a href=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-62986057>protests</a> following the death of Mahsa Amini), Iran intensified the <a href="https://explorer.ooni.org/chart/mat?probe_cc=IR&test_name=web_connectivity&domain=dns.google&since=2022-08-25&until=2022-09-25&axis_x=measurement_start_day">blocking of encrypted DNS (DoH)</a> services. We previously (in 2020) reported on the blocking of <a href=https://ooni.org/post/2020-iran-dot/>encrypted DNS (DoT)</a> services in Iran, but at the time, we found that they were blocked during the TLS handshake by means of destination-endpoint or SNI based filtering.

At the time, we found that 57% of the tested endpoints were blocked on at least one ISP, and that most blocking was implemented by interfering with the TLS handshake. As part of an <a href=https://www.ndss-symposium.org/wp-content/uploads/dnspriv21-02-paper.pdf>expanded study on encrypted DNS blocking</a> (in Iran, China, and Kazakhstan), we found that<a href=https://ooni.org/post/2022-doh-dot-paper-dnsprivacy21/> 50% of tested DoT endpoints were blocked</a> in Iran, while 92% of tested DoH endpoints worked.</p><p>In recent months, <a href="https://explorer.ooni.org/chart/mat?probe_cc=IR&test_name=web_connectivity&since=2022-08-25&until=2022-09-25&axis_x=measurement_start_day&axis_y=domain">OONI measurements from the testing of multiple DoH endpoints</a> on several networks in Iran showed signs of TLS based interference. But as of 20th September 2022, we observe a noticeable <em>change</em> in the blocking of domain-based DoH endpoints, as we view <em>both</em> TLS level interference and DNS based tampering.</p><div><a href=/post/2022-iran-blocks-social-media-mahsa-amini-protests/images/image1.png><img src=/post/2022-iran-blocks-social-media-mahsa-amini-protests/images/image1_hu56351c519d11be78485462b84b5b9f96_1490351_1000x800_fit_box_2.png srcset="/post/2022-iran-blocks-social-media-mahsa-amini-protests/images/image1_hu56351c519d11be78485462b84b5b9f96_1490351_2000x1600_fit_box_2.png 2x"></a></div><p><strong>Chart</strong>: OONI data on the blocking of popular DNS over HTTPS endpoints in Iran (source: <a href="https://explorer.ooni.org/chart/mat?probe_cc=IR&test_name=web_connectivity&since=2022-08-25&until=2022-09-25&axis_x=measurement_start_day&axis_y=domain">OONI MAT</a>).</p><p>From the above chart (which aggregates OONI measurement coverage from the testing of popular DoH endpoints in Iran), we can see that as of 20th September 2022:</p><ul><li>DoH endpoints that were <em>previously accessible</em> (such as <code>cloudflare-dns.com</code> and <code>doh.opendns.com</code>) started being blocked;</li><li>DoH endpoints that previously presented “anomalies” (due to TLS based interference, which is not automatically confirmed blocked) started to be annotated as “confirmed blocked” as well (as a result of ISPs implementing DNS based blocking by returning <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bogon_filtering>bogons</a>, enabling the automatic detection and confirmation of censorship).</li></ul><p>In other words, we observe a noticeable <em>change</em> in how the blocking of encrypted DNS is implemented in Iran (from 20th September 2022 onwards). Previously, we primarily observed TLS level interference, whereas now, most (tested) ISPs implement DNS based blocking of DoH endpoints as well. We also observe that this block has been expanded to more DoH endpoints, in comparison to previous months.</p><p>The availability of some measurements collected using <a href=https://github.com/ooni/probe/issues/2237>an experimental version of Web Connectivity</a> containing several data quality improvements allows us to further characterize the blocking techniques being employed by the censors. To illustrate that, we focus on <code>doh.dns.apple.com</code> <a href="https://explorer.ooni.org/search?since=2022-09-24&until=2022-09-25&probe_cc=IR&test_name=web_connectivity&domain=doh.dns.apple.com&failure=false">measurements</a> collected on 24th September 2022. The following table classifies these measurements by the number of times we observed specific results for different ASNs:</p><table><thead><tr><th>ASN</th><th>AS name</th><th>#dns</th><th>#tcpip</th><th>#tls</th><th>#success</th><th>count</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>197207</td><td>MCI</td><td>yes</td><td></td><td>yes</td><td></td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>197207</td><td>MCI</td><td>yes</td><td></td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>206065</td><td>Zi-Tel</td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td><td></td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td>206065</td><td>Zi-Tel</td><td>yes</td><td></td><td>yes</td><td></td><td>18</td></tr><tr><td>44244</td><td>Irancell</td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td><td></td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>58224</td><td>TCI</td><td>yes</td><td></td><td></td><td>yes</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>58224</td><td>TCI</td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td><td></td><td>yes</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>58224</td><td>TCI</td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td><td></td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>58224</td><td>TCI</td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>58224</td><td>TCI</td><td>yes</td><td></td><td>yes</td><td></td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>58224</td><td>TCI</td><td>yes</td><td></td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td><td>21</td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>Table</strong>: Failures and successes for <code>doh.dns.apple.com</code> using experimental Web Connectivity.</p><p>Each row of the table describes the number of times (indicated as <em>count</em>) in which we observed a given result for an ASN. The #dns column indicates whether we detected DNS blocking. The #tcpip column indicates whether we detected TCP/IP blocking. The #tls column indicates whether we detected blocking during the TLS handshake. The #success column indicates whether at least one of the available IP addresses was reachable (this experimental version of Web Connectivity tries all the available IP addresses and also uses IP addresses obtained from the test helper to detect all the possible forms of censorship that may be applied to a given input URL).</p><p>We can therefore conclude from the above table that <code>doh.dns.apple.com</code> was always censored by means of DNS and, in most cases, there was <em>also</em> TCP or TLS based blocking. However, it also indicates how, in a few cases, the censor failed to censor all the available IP addresses for the domain. These results thus allow us to reject the hypothesis that TLS based blocking solely depends on the SNI field.

likely aimed to limit its availability and force applications that could otherwise use HTTP/3 to use HTTPS, for which arguably there are more advanced network filtering techniques (since HTTPS predates HTTP/3 by around 20 years).</p><h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h2><p>Iran has had a tight grip on the internet for years, implementing <a href=https://ooni.org/post/iran-internet-censorship/>pervasive levels of internet censorship</a> (<a href="https://explorer.ooni.org/search?since=2022-08-25&until=2022-09-25&failure=false&probe_cc=IR&test_name=web_connectivity&only=confirmed">blocking numerous websites</a> and <a href=https://ooni.org/post/2021-how-signal-private-messenger-blocked-around-the-world/#iran>major apps</a>). Over the years, as anti-government protests emerged (such as the <a href=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/02/iran-protests-how-did-they-start-and-where-are-they-heading>protests in late 2017</a> and <a href=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/11/20/irans-protests-all-you-need-to-know-in-600-words/>November 2019</a>), Iranian authorities followed a pattern of <a href=https://ooni.org/post/2018-iran-protests/>blocking social media apps</a> that Iranians rely on for communication, information sharing, and coordination – even resorting to <a href=https://ooni.org/post/2019-iran-internet-blackout/>shutting networks entirely</a>. The latest censorship events that emerged in Iran in recent days amid the <a href=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/17/iran-protests-death-kurdish-woman-mahsaa-amini-morality-police>ongoing protests</a> follow the same pattern.</p><p>Specifically, the blocking of major social media platforms (such as <a href="https://explorer.ooni.org/chart/mat?probe_cc=IR&test_name=whatsapp&since=2022-08-24&until=2022-09-24&axis_x=measurement_start_day">WhatsApp</a> and <a href="https://explorer.ooni.org/chart/mat?probe_cc=IR&test_name=web_connectivity&domain=www.instagram.com&since=2022-08-25&until=2022-09-25&axis_x=measurement_start_day">Instagram</a>) suggest that Iranian authorities are attempting to control the narrative surrounding the ongoing protests and stifle the dissent. While some circumvention tools (such as <a href=https://psiphon.ca/>Psiphon</a> and <a href=https://snowflake.torproject.org/>Tor</a>) seem to work in Iran, the <a href="https://explorer.ooni.org/search?since=2022-09-22&until=2022-09-23&probe_cc=IR&test_name=web_connectivity&domain=play.googleapis.com&failure=false">blocking of Google Play Store</a> and <a href="https://explorer.ooni.org/search?since=2022-09-22&until=2022-09-23&probe_cc=IR&test_name=web_connectivity&domain=iosapps.itunes.apple.com&failure=false">Apple App Store</a> may limit Iranians’ ability to install or update apps. Meanwhile, the <a href="https://explorer.ooni.org/search?since=2022-09-22&until=2022-09-23&probe_cc=IR&test_name=web_connectivity&domain=dns.google&failure=false">increased blocking of encrypted DNS services</a> in Iran raises alarms, because the blocking of encrypted DNS will make censorship circumvention – <em>in an already heavily censored environment</em> – harder.</p><h2 id=acknowledgements>Acknowledgements</h2><p>We thank <a href=https://ooni.org/install>OONI Probe</a> users in Iran who contributed measurements, supporting this study.</p></main></div><footer class=p-4><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-12 col-md-4"><div class=pb-2><img src=/images/logos/ooni-horizontal.svg height=32px alt="OONI Logo"></div><div class=pb-4>Global community measuring internet censorship around the world.</div><div><div>© 2022 Open Observatory of Network Interference (OONI)</div><div><a href=https://github.com/ooni/license>Content available under a Creative Commons license.</a></div></div></div><div class="col-12 col-md-8"><div class=row><div class="mt-3 col-sm"><div class=footer-section-title>About</div><div class=pt-1><a href=/about/>OONI</a></div><div class=pt-1><a href=/about/data-policy/>Data Policy</a></div><div class=pt-1><a href=https://github.com/ooni/license/tree/master/data>Data License</a></div><div class=pt-1><a href=/about/#contact>Contact</a></div></div><div class="mt-3 col-sm"><div class=footer-section-title>OONI Probe</div><div class=pt-1><a href=https://ooni.org/install/>Install</a></div><div class=pt-1><a href=https://ooni.org/nettest/>Tests</a></div><div class=pt-1><a href=https://github.com/ooni>Source code</a></div><div class=pt-1><a href=https://api.ooni.io/>API</a></div></div><div class="mt-3 col-sm"><div class=footer-section-title>Updates</div><div class=pt-1><a href=/post/>Blog</a></div><div class=pt-1><a href=https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/ooni-talk>Mailing list</a></div><div class=pt-1><a href=https://slack.ooni.org/>Slack</a></div><ul class="pt-1 footer-links-social"><li><a class=twitter href=https://twitter.com/OpenObservatory>Twitter (@OpenObservatory)</a></li><li><a class=youtube href=https://www.youtube.com/c/OONIorg>Youtube (OONIorg)</a></li><li><a class=facebook href=https://facebook.com/ooni.org>Facebook (ooni.org)</a></li><li><a class=instagram href=https://www.instagram.com/openobservatory/>Instagram (@OpenObservatory)</a></li><li><a class=mastodon href=https://mastodon.social/@ooni>Mastodon (@ooni@mastodon.social)</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div></footer></body></html>
