Most ISPs in the Philippines are publicly listed corporations. In March 2022, the government lifted the 40 per cent foreign ownership restriction allowing foreign investors to acquire controlling stakes in Philippine telecommunications and transport companies.<sup id=fnref:12><a href=#fn:12 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>12</a></sup> Singapore state-owned telco Singtel has minority ownership of Globe while Japanese government-linked NTT owns a significant stake in PLDT. China&rsquo;s state-owned telco China Telecom owns 40 per cent of the newcomer Dito Telecomunnity.</p></li></ul><h2 id=political-landscape>Political landscape</h2><p>The Philippines’ main regulatory body for the information and communications technology (ICT) industry is the Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT), established under the Aquino administration in 2016.<sup id=fnref:13><a href=#fn:13 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>13</a></sup> The department serves as the primary policy, planning, coordinating, implementing, and administrative entity of the government’s executive branch in matters related to the national ICT development agenda. The DICT has three attached agencies: the National Telecommunications Commission (NTC), the National Privacy Commission (NPC), and the Cybercrime Investigation and Coordination Center (CICC). The Philippines’ telecommunication regulatory environment, however, falls below international standards.<sup id=fnref:14><a href=#fn:14 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>14</a></sup> resulting in substandard outcomes such as high prices of mobile phone and internet services and low internet quality.<sup id=fnref:15><a href=#fn:15 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>15</a></sup></p><p>In recent years, and with the COVID-19 pandemic increasing people’s reliance on digital technologies and with it the role of ICT regulators, agencies such as the NTC have come under fire for the “politicization” of the country’s telecommunications sector.<sup id=fnref:16><a href=#fn:16 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>16</a></sup></p><p>This was most apparent under the administration of former president Rodrigo Duterte, whose six-year presidency was marred by the systematic undermining of democratic institutions and countless attacks against critical media and activists. Various investigative reports and academic studies have uncovered the existence of state-sponsored troll armies<sup id=fnref:17><a href=#fn:17 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>17</a></sup> polluting online discourse and targeting government critics. News websites and progressive groups critical of the government have been linked to the Philippines’ communist insurgency, endangering the lives of journalists and activists.</p><p>One of the biggest blows to press freedom came in 2020, when the country’s largest broadcaster, ABS-CBN, was forced to go off the air after pro-government lawmakers rejected its bid for a renewed franchise.<sup id=fnref:18><a href=#fn:18 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>18</a></sup> The NTC was a key player in the ABS-CBN issue, as it is the regulatory agency that has supervision and control over the country’s telecommunications and broadcasting entities. Exercising its power, the NTC ordered the media giant to halt its television and radio broadcasting operations after its congressional franchise expired<sup id=fnref:19><a href=#fn:19 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>19</a></sup>. The move drew criticism, however, as the NTC order was deemed to be politicised amid the long-standing public feud between ABS-CBN and then-president Duterte.<sup id=fnref:20><a href=#fn:20 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>20</a></sup></p><p>In June 2022, before Duterte’s term of office ended, the NTC ordered internet service providers to block 26 websites,<sup id=fnref:21><a href=#fn:21 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>21</a></sup> including news sites Bulatlat and Pinoy Weekly, allegedly over their ties to “communist-terrorist groups”. The same month, news website Rappler was once again ordered to shut down after the Securities and Exchange Commission upheld its ruling to revoke the media company’s operating licence.</p><p>The current hostile attitude towards the press, attacks against critics, and use of disinformation strategies have facilitated a thriving environment for disinformation online. These, along with the complicity of Big Tech platforms, played a significant role in the electoral victory of incumbent president Ferdinand Marcos Jr, son of the late dictator who subjected the Philippines to martial law in the 1970s. Analysts have called the Marcoses’ successful return to power as a victory for disinformation, with historical revisionism as the main narrative perpetuated in online spaces.<sup id=fnref:22><a href=#fn:22 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>22</a></sup> Marcos Jr was formally inaugurated as the 17th President of the Philippines on June 30, 2022, with a six-year term until June 2028.</p><h2 id=legal-environment>Legal environment</h2><h3 id=freedom-of-expression>Freedom of expression</h3><p>Section 4, Article III of the 1987 Constitution guarantees freedom of speech.<sup id=fnref:23><a href=#fn:23 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>23</a></sup> Under the Duterte administration journalists and activists expressing views critical of the government were at heightened risk of being red-tagged or labelled as sympathisers of the communist insurgency. The National Task Force on Ending Local Communist Armed Conflict (NTF-ELCAC) is notorious for repeatedly red-tagging activists and government critics both through social media and official pronouncements.<sup id=fnref:24><a href=#fn:24 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>24</a></sup> The practice has resulted in the killings of numerous activists<sup id=fnref:25><a href=#fn:25 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>25</a></sup> while ordinary citizens have also been targeted,<sup id=fnref:26><a href=#fn:26 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>26</a></sup> most notably in April 2021 when organisers of community pantries were linked to rebel groups.</p><p>At the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, the government passed the Bayanihan to Heal as One Act which authorises the president to exercise emergency powers to ensure public order and safety.<sup id=fnref:27><a href=#fn:27 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>27</a></sup> One provision of the law, Section 6(f), drew criticism from rights groups as it penalises individuals or groups creating or spreading “false information” about the health crisis on social media and other platforms.<sup id=fnref:28><a href=#fn:28 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>28</a></sup> Within a month of its implementation, at least 47 people were apprehended for alleged violations.<sup id=fnref:29><a href=#fn:29 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>29</a></sup> The National Bureau of Investigation also issued summons to more than a dozen people for allegedly spreading false information,<sup id=fnref:30><a href=#fn:30 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>30</a></sup> including one who was targeted for his post on the alleged misuse of government funds.</p><h3 id=press-freedom>Press freedom</h3><h4 id=revised-penal-code>Revised Penal Code</h4><p>The guarantee for freedom of the press is provided for in the 1987 Constitution. In practice, however, journalists in the Philippines who are critical of politicians often face the threat of criminal defamation in carrying out their work. Libel laws are often used to harass, intimidate, and bully journalists who expose misconduct by public officials. The Revised Penal Code (RPC) provides for a prescription period of one year for libel, which upon conviction may result in imprisonment of up to six years and a fine of up to 6,000 pesos.</p><h4 id=cybercrime-prevention-act>Cybercrime Prevention Act</h4><p>The Cybercrime Prevention Act, passed in 2012, does not specify a prescription period for cyberlibel and since this law imposes a higher penalty for similar convictions than that in the RPC, the Department of Justice has interpreted the prescription period for the offence as 12 years.<sup id=fnref:31><a href=#fn:31 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>31</a></sup> The case of Maria Ressa and Reynaldo Santos Jr of the news website Rappler has become one of the most notable cyberlibel cases in recent years.<sup id=fnref:32><a href=#fn:32 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>32</a></sup> The charge against Ressa, Santos Jr, and Rappler and their subsequent conviction in 2020 drew criticism from local and international human rights organisations.<sup id=fnref:33><a href=#fn:33 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>33</a></sup> Similarly, in June 2022, a public official filed cyberlibel complaints – now dropped – against journalists from seven media outlets that reported on his involvement in a graft complaint.<sup id=fnref:34><a href=#fn:34 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>34</a></sup></p><h4 id=other-instruments>Other Instruments</h4><p>Politicians in the Philippines have also used other regulatory mechanisms to punish media organisations that give them unfavourable coverage. ABS-CBN, a major television and radio network, was forced to shut down in May 2020 after Congress members aligned to then-president Rodrigo Duterte denied the renewal of its broadcasting franchise which the network had held for 25 years.<sup id=fnref:35><a href=#fn:35 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>35</a></sup> In June 2022, just before the end of President Duterte&rsquo;s term, the National Telecommunications Commission (NTC) ordered internet service providers to block 26 websites,<sup id=fnref:36><a href=#fn:36 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>36</a></sup> including news sites Bulatlat and Pinoy Weekly, over alleged ties to “communist-terrorist groups”. The same month, Rappler was ordered to shut down after the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) upheld the ruling to revoke the media company’s operating licence<sup id=fnref:37><a href=#fn:37 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>37</a></sup>. Similar political interference in the regulation of Philippine broadcasting media has also been reported in the past, most notably the NTC gag order at the height of the &lsquo;Hello, Garci&rsquo; scandal in 2005.<sup id=fnref:38><a href=#fn:38 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>38</a></sup></p><h3 id=access-to-information>Access to information</h3><p>Section 7, Article III of the 1987 Constitution recognises &ldquo;the right of the people to information on matters of public concern&rdquo;. Section 28, Article II declares that &ldquo;the state adopts and implements a policy of full public disclosure of all its transactions involving public interest&rdquo;. Even though the Philippine Congress has yet to pass comprehensive legislation on access to information, these constitutional principles have been the foundation for the right to access information in case law, most notably in the 1989 Supreme Court case of <em>Valmonte v Belmonte</em>.<sup id=fnref:39><a href=#fn:39 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>39</a></sup></p><h4 id=executive-order-no-2-s-2016>Executive Order No 2, s 2016</h4><p>There have been a number of positive developments towards greater access to information in recent years. In July 2016, President Duterte signed the Freedom of Information Executive Order No 2, s 2016 which provides for the implementation of a freedom of information program within the executive branch under the purview of the Department of Justice and the Office of the Solicitor General. The executive order has had a knock-on effect on local government units across the Philippines with several of them passing their own freedom of information ordinances. The executive order has also renewed the pressure on Congress to pass the freedom of information bill that has been stalled since its earliest version was first tabled in the legislative body in the mid-1990s.<sup id=fnref:40><a href=#fn:40 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>40</a></sup></p><h3 id=privacy>Privacy</h3><h4 id=data-privacy-act-2012>Data Privacy Act 2012</h4><p>The Data Privacy Act 2012, which provides for the protection of personal data in the Philippines, came into effect in September 2016 after the establishment of the National Privacy Commission (NPC) and the promulgation of implementing rules and regulations of the Act.</p><p>The law covers the rights of individuals and the obligations of organisations with regard to the collection, storage, use, disclosure, retention, and disposal of personal data.<sup id=fnref:41><a href=#fn:41 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>41</a></sup> It also sets out penalties for violation of data protection law including fines of 100,000 to 5 million pesos, imprisonment from 6 months to 7 years, and if applicable, disqualification from public office.

The web connectivity measurements could not confirm any blocking by ISPs. However, a number of blocked websites could be confirmed through heuristic analysis.</p><p>Another limitation of this study is the number and types of websites included in the OONI Probe measurements. A total of 2,002 websites were tested during the six-month period but the number of different websites tested varies when compared month-to-month ranging from 1,742 to 1,861 websites. While the low variance indicates a good coverage of websites tested across the testing period, a number of limitations should be taken into account.</p><p>The global and country test lists contain a very small sample of URLs that may be visited by Philippine internet users. Testing web connectivity using the test lists is thus not representative of the whole internet in the Philippines. Some URLs included in the test lists could be outdated, miscategorised, or belonged to multiple categories which may have resulted in skewed or varying interpretations of the measurement data.</p><p>The measurements collected are also limited by the number of different ISPs covered. In any given month, only 10 to 19 different ISPs are included in the measurement data as compared to 23 different ISPs covered for the whole testing period. The high variance between these figures indicates less than ideal ISP coverage of the measurement data. There may be Philippine ISPs not included in some measurements that would return confirmed blocking and thus limit the data analysis.</p><p>Despite these limitations, the measurement data from OONI Probe is useful in providing a broad indication of the general depth and breadth of internet censorship in the Philippines. Similar studies in the future may overcome some of these limitations by deploying OONI Probe on more devices, running a consistent number of tests periodically, and having wider coverage of ISPs across the Philippines.</p><h3 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h3><p>During the reporting period, the Philippine government utilized a wide range of laws as grounds to restrict freedom of expression and opinion online. Media organizations critical of the Philippine government are consistently at the receiving end of these tactics, which have become commonplace under the term of former President Duterte. The use of cybercrime prevention and anti-terrorism laws to harass, intimidate, and bully Philippine journalists exacerbates the already hostile environment for the press, mired with violent practices like red tagging, enforced disappearance, and extrajudicial killings of media practitioners.</p><p>Specific to internet censorship, all 16 of the blocked websites were confirmed through further heuristic analysis based on measurements collected through OONI Probe. A comprehensive review of the country test list used in OONI Probe measurements could potentially improve the detection of network interference in the Philippines.</p><p>Further investigation is especially needed in anticipation of President Marcos Jr&rsquo;s expected continuation of his predecessor&rsquo;s censorship tactics and hardline stance against critics. Marcos’ camp, even before assuming the presidency, has already shunned and harassed journalists, favouring the influencers and vloggers who helped catapult him into power.</p><p>The internet remains relatively free and open in the Philippines as compared to other countries in Southeast Asia. But judging by current trends, laws and institutions will continue to be used to justify the censorship of critical voices both online and offline, all towards the President’s &ldquo;call for unity&rdquo; in the country and among Filipinos.<sup id=fnref:53><a href=#fn:53 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>53</a></sup></p><h2 id=annex-ph-1-probed-isps>Annex PH-1: Probed ISPs</h2><p><strong>Probed ISPs:</strong> Angeles City Cable Television Network, Inc.

A domain is a name that is commonly attributed to websites (when they’re created), so that they can be more easily accessed and remembered. For example, twitter.com is the domain of the Twitter website. However, computers can’t connect to internet services through domain names, but based on IP addresses: the digital address of each service on the internet. Similarly, in the physical world, you would need the address of a house (rather than the name of the house itself) in order to visit it. The Domain Name System (DNS) is what is responsible for transforming a human- readable domain name (such as ooni.org) into its numerical IP address counterpart (in this case:104.198.14.52), thus allowing your computer to access the intended website.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>HTTP</strong></td><td>The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is the underlying protocol used by the World Wide Web to transfer or exchange data across the internet. The HTTP protocol allows communication between a client and a server. It does so by handling a client’s request to connect to a server, and the server’s response to the client’s request. All websites include an HTTP (or HTTPS) prefix (such as <a href=http://example.com/>http://example.com/</a>) so that your computer (the client) can request and receive the content of a website (hosted on a server). All websites include an HTTP (or HTTPS) prefix (such as <a href=http://example.com/>http://example.com/</a>) so that your computer (the client) can request and receive the content of a website (hosted on a server). The transmission of data over the HTTP protocol is unencrypted.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>ISP</strong></td><td>An Internet Service Provider (ISP) is an organization that provides services for accessing and using the internet. ISPs can be state-owned, commercial, community-owned, non-profit, or otherwise privately owned. Vodafone, AT&amp;T, Airtel, and MTN are examples of ISPs.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Middle boxes</strong></td><td>A middlebox is a computer networking device that transforms, inspects, filters, or otherwise manipulates traffic for purposes other than packet forwarding. Many Internet Service Providers (ISPs) around the world use middleboxes to improve network performance, provide users with faster access to websites, and for a number of other networking purposes. Sometimes though, middleboxes are also used to implement internet censorship and/or surveillance. The OONI Probe app includes two tests designed to measure networks with the aim of identifying the presence of middleboxes.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>TCP</strong></td><td>The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is one of the main protocols on the internet. To connect to a website, your computer needs to establish a TCP connection to the address of that website. TCP works on top of the Internet Protocol (IP), which defines how to address computers on the internet. When speaking to a machine over the TCP protocol you use an IP and port pair, which looks something like this: 10.20.1.1:8080. The main difference between TCP and (another very popular protocol called) UDP is that TCP has the notion of a “connection”, making it a “reliable” transport protocol.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>TLS</strong></td><td>Transport Layer Security (TLS) – also referred to as “SSL” – is a cryptographic protocol that allows you to maintain a secure, encrypted connection between your computer and an internet service. When you connect to a website through TLS, the address of the website will begin with HTTPS (such as <a href=https://www.facebook.com/)>https://www.facebook.com/)</a>, instead of HTTP.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>A comprehensive glossary related to OONI can be accessed here: <a href=https://ooni.org/support/glossary/>https://ooni.org/support/glossary/</a>.</p><h2 id=annex-ii-methodology>Annex II: Methodology</h2><h3 id=data><strong>Data</strong></h3><p>Data computed based on the heuristics for this report can be downloaded here: <a href=https://github.com/Sinar/imap-data>https://github.com/Sinar/imap-data</a> whereas aggregated data can be downloaded from <a href=https://explorer.ooni.org/>OONI Explorer</a>.</p><h3 id=coverage><strong>Coverage</strong></h3><p>The iMAP State of Internet Censorship Country Report covers the findings of network measurement collected through Open Observatory of Network Interference (OONI) <a href=https://ooni.org/install/>OONI Probe App</a> that measures the blocking of websites, instant messaging apps, circumvention tools and network tampering.

OONI takes measures to remove them from the collected measurements, to protect its users from <a href=https://ooni.org/about/risks/>potential risks</a>. However, there may be instances where users’ IP addresses and other potentially personally-identifiable information are unintentionally collected, if such information is included in the HTTP headers or other metadata of measurements. For example, this can occur if the tested websites include tracking technologies or custom content based on a user’s network location.</p><h4 id=network-measurements>Network measurements</h4><p>The types of network measurements that OONI collects depend on the types of tests that are run. Specifications about each OONI test can be viewed through its <a href=https://github.com/ooni/spec>git repository</a>, and details about what collected network measurements entail can be viewed through <a href=https://explorer.ooni.org/world/>OONI Explorer</a> or through <a href=https://api.ooni.io/>OONI’s measurement API</a>.</p><p>In order to derive meaning from the measurements collected, OONI processes the data types mentioned above to answer the following questions:</p><ul><li>Which types of OONI tests were run?</li><li>In which countries were those tests run?</li><li>In which networks were those tests run?</li><li>When were tests run?</li><li>What types of network interference occurred?</li><li>In which countries did network interference occur?</li><li>In which networks did network interference occur?</li><li>When did network interference occur?</li><li>How did network interference occur?</li></ul><p>To answer such questions, OONI’s pipeline is designed to answer such questions by processing network measurements data to enable the following:</p><ul><li>Attributing measurements to a specific country.</li><li>Attributing measurements to a specific network within a country.</li><li>Distinguishing measurements based on the specific tests that were run for their collection.</li><li>Distinguishing between “normal” and “anomalous” measurements (the latter indicating that a form of network tampering is likely present).</li><li>Identifying the type of network interference based on a set of heuristics for DNS tampering, TCP/IP blocking, and HTTP blocking.</li><li>Identifying block pages based on a set of heuristics for HTTP blocking.</li><li>Identifying the presence of “middle boxes” within tested networks.</li></ul><p>According to OONI, false positives may occur within the processed data due to a number of reasons. DNS resolvers (operated by Google or a local ISP) often provide users with IP addresses that are closest to them geographically. While this may appear to be a case of DNS tampering, it is actually done with the intention of providing users with faster access to websites. Similarly, false positives may emerge when tested websites serve different content depending on the country that the user is connecting from, or in the cases when websites return failures even though they are not tampered with.</p><p>Furthermore, measurements indicating HTTP or TCP/IP blocking might actually be due to temporary HTTP or TCP/IP failures, and may not conclusively be a sign of network interference. It is therefore important to test the same sets of websites across time and to cross-correlate data, prior to reaching a conclusion on whether websites are in fact being blocked.</p><p>Since block pages differ from country to country and sometimes even from network to network, it is quite challenging to accurately identify them. OONI uses a series of heuristics to try to guess if the page in question differs from the expected control, but these heuristics can often result in false positives. For this reason OONI only says that there is a confirmed instance of blocking when a block page is detected.</p><p>Upon collection of more network measurements, OONI continues to develop its data analysis heuristics, based on which it attempts to accurately identify censorship events.</p><p>The full list of country-specific test lists containing confirmed blocked websites in Myanmar, Cambodia, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam can be viewed here: <a href=https://github.com/citizenlab/test-lists>https://github.com/citizenlab/test-lists</a>.</p><h4 id=heading></h4><h4 id=confirmed-vs-heuristics>Confirmed vs Heuristics</h4><p>Confirmed OONI measurements were based on blockpages with fingerprints recorded here <a href=https://github.com/ooni/blocking-fingerprints>https://github.com/ooni/blocking-fingerprints</a>.</p><p>Hence, heuristics as below were run on raw measurements on all countries under iMAP to further confirm blockings.</p><p>Firstly, IP addresses with more than 10 domains were identified. Then each of the IP address was checked for the following:</p><p><img src=/post/2022-state-of-internet-censorship-philippines/images/image1.png></p><p>When blocking is determined, any domain redirected to these IP addresses would be marked as ‘dns.confirmed’.</p><p>Secondly, HTTP titles and bodies were analysed to determine blockpages. This <a href="https://explorer.ooni.org/measurement/20220411T125618Z_webconnectivity_IN_58678_n1_6zLG8ySiJHIq07Un?input=http%3A%2F%2Finfluence.in%2F">example</a> shows that the HTTP returns the text <em>‘The URL has been blocked as per the instructions of the DoT in compliance to the orders of Court of Law’</em>. Any domain redirected to these HTTP titles and bodies would be marked as ‘http.confirmed’.</p><p>As a result, false positives are eliminated and more confirmed blockings were obtained including countries like Cambodia, Vietnam and Philippines which have no confirmed blocking fingerprints on OONI.</p><p>In the case of Hong Kong, the results of the heuristics showed external censorship from outside of the country instead of local censorship. Thus, the local researchers had analysed the OONI measurements manually to identify confirmed blockings. The domains identified were based on the timed-out instances.</p><h2 id=about-imap>About iMAP</h2><p>Internet Monitoring Action Project (iMAP) aims to establish regional and in-country networks that monitor network interference and restrictions to the freedom of expression online in 9 countries: Myanmar, Cambodia, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam.
