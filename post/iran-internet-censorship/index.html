in Iran and in <a href=https://explorer.ooni.org/world/>more than 200 other countries</a> around the
world.</p><p>This research report, written by the <a href=https://ooni.org/>Open Observatory of Network Interference (OONI)</a> in collaboration
with <a href=https://asl19.org/>ASL19</a>, <a href=https://www.article19.org/>ARTICLE 19</a>, and <a href=https://smallmedia.org.uk/>Small Media</a>, presents censorship findings from
the analysis of <a href=https://explorer.ooni.org/country/IR>thousands of network measurements</a>
collected from 60 networks in Iran over the last three years.</p><p>The aim of this study is to increase the transparency of information
controls in Iran through the interpretation of empirical
<a href=https://api.ooni.io/files/by_country/IR>data</a>.</p><p>The following sections of this report provide information about Iran‚Äôs
network landscape and internet use, its legal environment with respect
to freedom of expression, as well as about cases of censorship that have
previously been reported in the country. The remainder of the report
documents the methodology and key findings of this study.</p><h1 id=background>Background</h1><h2 id=network-landscape>Network landscape</h2><p>Iran‚Äôs internet landscape is characterised by an infrastructure of
control (see page 8-10 of the Open Net Initiative‚Äôs (ONI) <a href=https://opennet.net/sites/opennet.net/files/iranreport.pdf>After the Green Movement</a>
report). The very nature of how Iran connects to the world wide web is
enwrapped in the Islamic Republic‚Äôs core institutions.</p><p>Internet gateways into Iran are managed by the Telecommunication
Infrastructure Company (TIC) which maintains a monopoly, and is managed
by the Ministry of Information Communications and Technology. The TCI
also owns the Data Communication Company of Iran (DCI), which is the
main ISP of the country. Of greatest concern within this infrastructure
(visualized in the infographic from ONI below) is the fact that a
consortium of private businesses owned by the paramilitary institution
of the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_Revolutionary_Guard_Corps>Revolutionary Guards</a>
(known for their arrests, surveillance, and repression of human rights
defenders, journalists, bloggers, and internet users exercising their
rights to freedom of expression online) owns about 50% of the shares of
the Telecommunications Company of Iran (which operates the TIC) when the
government attempted to privatize it in 2007.</p><p><img src=/post/iran/ir-infrastructure.png alt="Infrastructure landscape"></p><p>Source: <a href=https://opennet.net/sites/opennet.net/files/iranreport.pdf>After the Green Movement: Internet Controls in Iran, 2009-2012</a>,

significant influence over the company that routes all the internet
traffic through the country. As ONI

‚Äú<a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/1209.6398>hidden internet</a>‚Äù, with private IP
addresses allocated on the country‚Äôs national network.
Telecommunications entities were found to allow private addresses to
route domestically, whether intentionally or unintentionally, creating a
hidden network only reachable within Iran. Moreover, the research found
that records such as DNS entries suggest that servers are assigned both
domestic IP addresses and global ones.</p><h2 id=internet-use>Internet use</h2><p>According to recent statistics

Additionally, the erosion of freedom of expression can be seen through
the institutionalisation of censorship bodies. Overall, legal
protections for freedom of expression and the press are somewhat
ambiguous: rights are formally enumerated, while the opportunities in
which they may be exercised are restricted. To unpack this tension, we
turn to a few key passages from the Iranian constitution.</p><p><strong>The 1979 Constitution of Iran</strong> protects the rights to free
expression, peaceful assembly and association in Articles 24, 26, and 27
respectively, but also permits these rights to be curtailed in
circumstances not compatible with the ICCPR. These include very vague
terms that are not defined, enabling arbitrary restrictions on the
exercise of these rights:</p><ul><li><p>Freedom of expression can be restricted if it is found to be
‚Äúdetrimental to the fundamental principles of Islam or the rights
of the public‚Äù (Articles 20 and 24);</p></li><li><p>Article 40 prohibits the exercise of constitutional rights in a
manner deemed to be ‚Äúinjurious to others‚Äù or ‚Äúdetrimental to
public interests‚Äù;</p></li><li><p>The preamble of the Constitution specifies that the media must
‚Äústrictly refrain from diffusion and propagation of destructive
and anti-Islamic practices‚Äù.</p></li></ul><p><strong>The Penal Code (IPC)</strong> contains broad provisions criminalising
expression that are against international human rights law; including
criminal insult (see <a href=http://www.iranhrdc.org/english/human-rights-documents/iranian-codes/1000000351-islamic-penal-code-of-the-islamic-republic-of-iran-book-five.html>Book Five, Articles 513, 514, 515, 517, 609</a>)
and blasphemy provisions (see <a href=http://www.iranhrdc.org/english/human-rights-documents/iranian-codes/1000000351-islamic-penal-code-of-the-islamic-republic-of-iran-book-five.html>Book Two, Part 2, Chapter 5</a>),
criminalisation of disseminating ‚Äòpropaganda against the State‚Äô (<a href=http://www.iranhrdc.org/english/human-rights-documents/iranian-codes/1000000455-english-translation-of-books-1-and-2-of-the-new-islamic-penal-code.html#34>Book One, Article 286</a>),
spreading false rumours, lies, and creating ‚Äúanxiety and unease in the
public‚Äôs mind‚Äù (<a href=http://www.iranhrdc.org/english/human-rights-documents/iranian-codes/1000000455-english-translation-of-books-1-and-2-of-the-new-islamic-penal-code.html#34>Book One, Article 286</a>).
Penalties include prison sentences (ranging from 3 months to 5 years),
flogging, and even death. Together with other vague and overbroad
provisions, such as ‚Äúacting against national security‚Äù, ‚Äúmembership in
an illegal organization‚Äù, and ‚Äúparticipation in an illegal gathering‚Äù
(<a href=http://www.iranhrdc.org/english/human-rights-documents/iranian-codes/1000000455-english-translation-of-books-1-and-2-of-the-new-islamic-penal-code.html#34>Book Five, Article 502, 505, 507, 510, 511, 512</a>)
these provisions are arbitrarily interpreted to criminalise journalists,
bloggers, human rights defenders and minority groups as well as others
legitimately exercising their rights.</p><p><strong>The Press Law:</strong> Article 24 of the Constitution protects press
freedom, but not for media deemed ‚Äúdetrimental to the fundamental
principles of Islam or the rights of the public‚Äù. Combined with the
repressive Press Law, severe restrictions on media freedom remain the
norm (read more about the Press Law
<a href=http://irandataportal.syr.edu/press-law>here</a>).</p><p>Examples of problematic provisions of the Press Law include:</p><ul><li><p>Article 2 requires the press to pursue at least one of five
‚Äúlegitimate objectives‚Äù, which include ‚Äúto campaign against
manifestations of imperialistic culture‚Äù and ‚Äúto propagate and
promote genuine Islamic culture and sound ethical principles‚Äù;</p></li><li><p>Articles 6 prohibits the publishing of an exceptionally broad
spectrum of content including atheistic articles, those
prejudicial to Islamic codes, insulting Islam and/or its
sanctities, offending senior Islamic jurists, those quoting
articles from the ‚Äúdeviant press‚Äù or groups which are seen as
opposing Islam, or any publication deemed contradictory to the
Constitution;</p></li></ul><p>In October 2016, President Rouhani‚Äôs administration proposed a
<a href=https://www.iranhumanrights.org/2016/10/hassan-rouhani-government-bills-to-restrict-media/>new bill</a>
(the ‚ÄòComprehensive Mass Media Regulation‚Äô) to replace the current Press
Law that will impose greater restrictions on media freedom. If
introduced, the bill raises concerns as it gives more leeway to judges
and prosecutors to determine whether an offence has been committed,
thereby facilitating the politically motivated judicial harassment of
journalists and newspapers both offline and online.</p><p><strong>The Computer Crimes Law:</strong> Adopted by the Parliament in January 2010,
the Computer Crimes Law is saturated with provisions that criminalise
legitimate expression in the digital space, including draconian
content-based restrictions designed to allow the State to exert
unfettered control in the sphere where its authority is most frequently
challenged.</p><p>Among the content-based restrictions targeting online expression are the
offences against ‚Äúpublic morality and chastity‚Äù (Articles 14 and 15) and
the ‚Äúdissemination of lies‚Äù (Articles 16 ‚Äì 18) that are engineered to
ensnare all forms of legitimate expression. These include broad
defamation and obscenity provisions that are antithetical to the right
of freedom of expression. Essential elements of offenses are described
with ambiguity and in vague and overbroad terms, giving the government
unfettered discretion to pursue its own prerogatives above the interests
of the public and the standards set by the international human rights
law.</p><p>The Computer Crimes Law mandates severe sentences that penalise
legitimate expression and offend the principle of proportionality,
without defences for individuals acting in the public interest. The
availability of the death penalty (Article 14) for crimes committed
online against public morality and chastity is particularly abhorrent.
Other sanctions include lengthy custodial sentences (Articles 14, 16, 18
and 27), excessive fines (Articles 1, 2, 3, 14, 16, 18 and 21), and
judicial orders to close organisations (Article 20) and ban individuals
from using electronic communications (Article 27). These penalties also
apply to Internet Service Providers that fail to enforce content-based
restrictions (Articles 21 and 23), incentivising the private sector to
promulgate Iran‚Äôs censorship culture.</p><p><strong>The institutionalisation of online censorship:</strong> A number of
regulatory bodies with extremely opaque structures have been founded
since 2009 with mandates to restrict access to and use of the internet.
These bodies can be divided into three tiers: the first constituting
high-level policymaking councils; the second made up of executive
decision-making bodies; and the third including a range of enforcement
agencies.</p><p><strong>Policymaking:</strong> The principal policymaking body is the Supreme Council
on Cyberspace (SCC), which develops Iran‚Äôs domestic and international
cyber policies, with members including Iran‚Äôs President and the Head of
the Judiciary. This council is overseen by the Supreme Cultural
Revolution Council (SCRC) which was set up in 1980, and the Supreme
Leader is only person who can overrule their decisions. The SCRC is
dominated by Islamic fundamentalists, based in the city of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qom>Qom</a>,
and made up of the clerical elites making strategic decisions
influencing the Supreme Leader. The <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Iran>President of Iran</a> is the ex-officio
chairman of the Council.</p><p><strong>Executive decision-making bodies:</strong> This tier includes executive
decision-making bodies such as the Committee Charged with Determining
Offensive Content (CCDOC), and the Ministry of Information and Cultural
Guidance (MICG).</p><p>The CCDOC identifies sites that carry prohibited content, communicates
the standards to be used in identifying unauthorised websites to the
Telecommunication Company of Iran (TCI), other major ISPs and the
Ministry of Communication and Information Technology and makes website
blocking decisions. The public may ask the CCDOC to block or unblock a
website via an online request form. The final decision will be made by
the Committee. The precise number of blocked websites in Iran is not
publicly available.</p><p>In January 2010, the CCDOC issued a ‚Äúlist of Internet offences‚Äù which
would lead up to blocking a website. The list is very long and targets a
wide range of areas, including anything that is contrary to ‚Äúthe public
morals and chastity,‚Äù ‚Äúreligious values‚Äù and ‚Äúsecurity and social
peace,‚Äù and anything that is ‚Äúhostile towards government officials and
institutions‚Äù or which ‚Äúfacilitates the commission of a crime,‚Äù
including circumventing censorship or bypassing filtering systems. It
also lists ‚Äúcriminal content in relation to parliamentary and
presidential elections‚Äù.</p><p>The CCDOC is not independent of the Government but is an arm of the
Executive. It is headed by the Prosecutor General, and its other members
are representatives from 12 governmental bodies. Key members include the
Chief of Police and representatives of the Ministries of: Intelligence;
Islamic Guidance; and Communication and Information Technology.
International standards require that the determination of what content
should be blocked should only be undertaken by a competent judicial
authority or body which is independent of political, commercial or other
unwarranted influences to ensure that blocking is not used as a means of
censorship.</p><p>The SCC and the CCDOC also have seven members in common, which allows
for policy diffusion and institutional alignment.</p><p><strong>Enforcement agencies:</strong> A number of enforcement agencies are
responsible for taking action against offenders. Iran‚Äôs Cyber Police
unit (FATA), tasked with fighting ‚Äúdigital criminals‚Äù, is the most
notorious. In the chain of command of internet censorship in Iran, FATA
is the policing body that acts on information provided by the SCC and
CCDOC.</p><p><strong>Summary</strong></p><p>The Iranian Government has developed a centralised system for internet
filtering, created institutions tasked with monitoring Internet use and
censorship of content, engaged the Revolutionary Guard Corps in
enforcing Internet content standards, and entrenched many of these
practices through legislation in the Computer Crimes Law. While certain
rights to freedom of expression are held within the Iranian
constitution, a number of provisions within both the constitution, the
penal code, and the press laws aim to restrict these values based on
vague and often arbitrary principles meant to shield ‚ÄòIslam‚Äô or
‚Äònational security‚Äô, with very little regard to proportionality.</p><h2 id=reported-cases-of-internet-censorship>Reported cases of internet censorship</h2><p>Iran‚Äôs censorship system is one of the most sophisticated in the world.
Over the years, since the introduction of the internet in Iran, the
government has employed different methods to censor it and its
censorship methods have progressively become more complicated. Here we
present a list summarizing the methods that have been employed so far
mainly based on literature review done by <a href=https://censorbib.nymity.ch/pdf/Tschantz2016a.pdf>TAAP16</a> and <a href=https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/foci13/foci13-aryan.pdf>AAH13</a>.</p><p>Originally the government delegate the task of censorship to the ISPs to
deploy a IP and keyword based censorship system, moving to a hybrid of
central/ISP based system and eventually after 2009 moving to a central
censorship system. With the popularity of servers hosting multiple sites
and the introduction of CDNs, it moves away from blocking IPs and relies
on censoring host names in HTTP or SNI requests. It also uses throttling
via packet dropping to deter people from services which host a mix of
undesirable and benign content such as Amazon S3 services.</p><p>While maintaining mainly a blacklist system, censorship has been more
aggressive during politically sensitive occasions, such as days leading
to organized protests or elections, and engaged in protocol blacklisting
or even white listing. In 2012, for brief period of time, Iran blocked
TLS protocols by identifying the TLS handshake. During the months
leading up to the 2013 presidential election, the censor first throttled
encryption protocols, such as TLS and SSH. During the days leading up to
the election, the censor only whitelisted HTTP protocol and throttled
any other (known or unknown protocol) to the level of dropping after 60
seconds.</p><p>Iran also targets censorship circumvention tools. <a href=https://www.torproject.org/>Tor connections</a>, for example, have been
blocked by various methods, including the blocking of the Tor directory
authorities, identifying the DH prime used in Tor TLS handshake,
singling out the TLS certificate validity length etc. Iranian ISPs have
also actively participated in Psiphon client-server negotiation protocol
for receiving new proxy IP addresses and effectively blocking Psiphon&rsquo;s
proxies. A new law by the Supreme Council of Cyberspace (SCC) entitled
‚ÄúPolicies and Actions Organizing Social Media Messaging Applications‚Äù
(see Article 19‚Äôs translation on page 13
<a href=https://www.article19.org/data/files/medialibrary/38874/Tightening-the-Net_3-English-version.pdf>here</a>),
created a new legal framework to coerce controls online in the absence
of technical censorship capabilities.</p><p>Recent efforts that have been tracked by researchers have followed the
technical and policy implications of the ‚Äúintelligent filtering‚Äù
project. The project was initiated under the Ahmadinejad government with
the intention to unblock a number of currently censored platforms such
as Facebook and Twitter through targeted censorship. However, because of
the difficulties of HTTPS blocking, the project only experienced
technical implementation through Instagram.
<a href=https://advox.globalvoices.org/2015/05/07/new-research-iran-is-using-intelligent-censorship-on-instagram/>Investigations</a>
into the content and type of blocking by Frederic Jacobs and Mahsa
Alimardani eventually led to Instagram enabling HTTPS on its mobile
application (previously only available on the web browser) in order to
limit this type of targeted censorship.</p><p>Following the initiation of Instagram encryption across both web based
and mobile application based access, there were some cases of select
images not being accessed in Iran. Preliminary investigations by the
<a href=https://wiki.digitalmethods.net/Dmi/ExploringInformationControlsByIranOnInstagram>University of Amsterdam‚Äôs Digital Methods Initiative</a>
indicated this to be collateral damage from Content Delivery Networks
(CDN) that Instagram shared with it‚Äôs parent company, Facebook, which is
blocked in Iran. As of February 2016 however, the government has
<a href=https://www.iranhumanrights.org/2016/02/iran-will-spend-36m-on-smart-filtering/>announced</a>
they are devoting $36 million USD to the development of ‚Äúintelligent
filtering.‚Äù According to the New York based human rights NGO <a href=https://www.iranhumanrights.org/2016/02/iran-will-spend-36m-on-smart-filtering/>Campaign for Human Rights in Iran</a>
(CHRI) there is very ‚Äúlittle likelihood of smart filtering capabilities
inside of Iran.‚Äù</p><p>While technical capabilities for Iranian censorship do not extend beyond
entire platform blocks, Iran‚Äôs strongest tactics have been in account
seizures and in attempting to incentivize companies to cooperate with
them. For Telegram, for example, the foremost messaging and social media
application for Iranian users, with over 40 million monthly users
(statistic is from Telegram founder <a href="https://twitter.com/durov/status/854472773137256448?lang=en">Pavel Durov</a>),
the government has been able to <a href=https://www.article19.org/resources.php/resource/38678/en/iran:-arrests-and-intimidation-of-telegram-administrators-and-journalists-ahead-of-the-elections>physically takeover certain accounts</a>
through arrests and detentions of the administrators running Telegram
channels. The government has also worked to institutionalize incentives
for platforms such as Telegram to cooperate with the government, as
opposed to implementing technical means to control them. An unsuccessful
ultimatum to all foreign technology companies was given in 2016, which
gave a year to applications such as Telegram to either comply with
authorities, and bring all data for Iranian users into the country (with
possibly government oversight) or face censorship.</p><h1 id=methodology-measuring-internet-censorship-in-iran>Methodology: Measuring internet censorship in Iran</h1><p>The results of this study are based on a three phase process:</p><ul><li><p>Review of the <a href=https://github.com/citizenlab/test-lists/blob/master/lists/ir.csv>Citizen Lab‚Äôs test list for Iran</a></p></li><li><p>OONI network measurement testing</p></li><li><p>Data analysis</p></li></ul><p>A list of URLs that are relevant and commonly accessed in Iran was
created by the Citizen Lab in 2014 for the purpose of enabling network

this study, this list of URLs was revised and extended to include
additional URLs. These, along with <a href=https://github.com/citizenlab/test-lists/blob/master/lists/global.csv>other URLs</a>
that are commonly accessed around the world, were tested for blocking
using <a href=https://github.com/TheTorProject/ooni-probe>OONI‚Äôs free software tests</a>. Tests were run
from local vantage points across Iran. Using the network measurement
data that was collected from these tests, researchers processed and
analyzed this report using a standard set of heuristics for detecting
internet censorship and traffic manipulation.</p><p>This study analyzes network measurement data collected from Iran between
22nd September 2014 to 4th September 2017.</p><h2 id=review-of-the-citizen-labs-test-list-for-iran>Review of the Citizen Lab‚Äôs test list for Iran</h2><p>An important part of identifying censorship is determining <em>which</em>
websites to examine for blocking.</p><p>OONI‚Äôs <a href=https://github.com/TheTorProject/ooni-probe>software</a> (called
<em>OONI Probe</em>) is designed to examine URLs contained in specific lists
(‚Äútest lists‚Äù) for censorship. By default, OONI Probe examines the
‚Äú<a href=https://github.com/citizenlab/test-lists/blob/master/lists/global.csv>global test list</a>‚Äù,
which includes a wide range of internationally relevant websites, most
of which are in English. These websites fall under <a href=https://github.com/citizenlab/test-lists/blob/master/lists/00-LEGEND-new_category_codes.csv>30 categories</a>,
ranging from news media, file sharing and culture, to provocative or
objectionable categories, like pornography, political criticism, and
hate speech.</p><p>These categories ensure that a wide range of different types of websites
are tested. The main reason why objectionable categories (such as
‚Äúpornography‚Äù and ‚Äúhate speech‚Äù) are included for testing is because
they are more likely to be blocked due to their nature, enabling the
development of heuristics for detecting censorship elsewhere within a
country.</p><p>In addition to testing the URLs included in the global test list,
OONI Probe is also designed to examine a test list which is specifically
created for the country that the user is running OONI Probe from, if such
a list exists. Unlike the global test list, <a href=https://github.com/citizenlab/test-lists/tree/master/lists>country-specific test lists</a>
include websites that are relevant and commonly accessed within specific
countries, often in local languages. Like the global test list,
country-specific test lists are divided into <a href=https://github.com/citizenlab/test-lists/blob/master/lists/00-LEGEND-new_category_codes.csv>30 categories</a>.</p><p>All test lists are managed by the <a href=https://citizenlab.org/>Citizen Lab</a> on
<a href=https://github.com/citizenlab/test-lists>GitHub</a>. As part of this
study, OONI reviewed the Citizen Lab‚Äôs <a href=https://github.com/citizenlab/test-lists/blob/master/lists/ir.csv>test list for Iran</a>,adding
additional URLs, and updating categorization. Overall, <a href=https://github.com/citizenlab/test-lists/blob/master/lists/ir.csv>894 URLs</a>
that are relevant to Iran were tested as part of this study. The URLs
included in the Citizen Lab‚Äôs <a href=https://github.com/citizenlab/test-lists/blob/master/lists/global.csv>global list</a>
(1,107 unique URLs) were also tested.</p><p>It is important to acknowledge that the findings of this study are
limited to the websites that were tested, and do not provide a complete
view of other censorship events that may have occurred during the
testing period.</p><h2 id=ooni-network-measurement-testing>OONI network measurement testing</h2><p>Since 2012, OONI has developed multiple <a href=https://github.com/TheTorProject/ooni-probe>free and open source software tests</a> designed to

and the recently updated ‚Äú<a href=https://github.com/citizenlab/test-lists/blob/master/lists/ir.csv>Iranian test list</a>‚Äù)
were blocked during the testing period and if so, how. The Vanilla Tor
test was run to examine the reachability of the <a href=https://www.torproject.org/>Tor network</a>, while the WhatsApp, Facebook
Messenger and Telegram tests were run to examine whether these instant
messaging apps were blocked in Iran during the testing period. The
remaining tests check whether ‚Äúmiddleboxes‚Äù (systems placed in the
network between the user and a control server) that could potentially be
responsible for censorship and/or surveillance were present in the
tested networks.</p><p>The sections below document how each of these tests measure internet
censorship and traffic manipulation.</p><h3 id=web-connectivity-test>Web Connectivity test</h3><p>This
<a href=https://github.com/TheTorProject/ooni-probe/blob/master/ooni/nettests/blocking/web_connectivity.py>test</a>
examines whether websites are reachable and if they are not, it attempts
to determine whether access to them is blocked through DNS tampering,
TCP/IP blocking or by a transparent HTTP proxy. Specifically, this test
is designed to perform the following:</p><ul><li><p>Resolver identification</p></li><li><p>DNS lookup</p></li><li><p>TCP connect</p></li><li><p>HTTP GET request</p></li></ul><p>By default, this test performs the above (excluding the first step,
which is performed only over the network of the user) both over a
control server and over the network of the user. If the results from
both networks match, then there is no clear sign of network
interference; but if the results are different, the websites that the
user is testing are likely censored.</p><p>Further information is provided below, explaining how each step
performed under the web connectivity test works.</p><p><strong>1. Resolver identification</strong></p><p>The domain name system (DNS) is what is responsible for transforming a
host name (e.g. torproject.org) into an IP address (e.g. 38.229.72.16).
Internet Service Providers (ISPs), amongst others, run DNS resolvers
which map IP addresses to hostnames. In some circumstances though, ISPs
map the requested host names to the wrong IP addresses, which is a form
of tampering.</p><p>As a first step, the web connectivity test attempts to identify which
DNS resolver is being used by the user. It does so by performing a DNS
query to special domains (such as whoami.akamai.com) which will disclose
the IP address of the resolver.</p><p><strong>2. DNS lookup</strong></p><p>Once the web connectivity test has identified the DNS resolver of the
user, it then attempts to identify which addresses are mapped to the
tested host names by the resolver. It does so by performing a DNS
lookup, which asks the resolver to disclose which IP addresses are
mapped to the tested host names, as well as which other host names are
linked to the tested host names under DNS queries.</p><p><strong>3. TCP connect</strong></p><p>The web connectivity test will then try to connect to the tested
websites by attempting to establish a TCP session on port 80 (or port
443 for URLs that begin with HTTPS) for the list of IP addresses that
were identified in the previous step (DNS lookup).</p><p><strong>4. HTTP GET request</strong></p><p>As the web connectivity test connects to tested websites (through the
previous step), it sends requests through the HTTP protocol to the
servers which are hosting those websites. A server normally responds to
an HTTP GET request with the content of the webpage that is requested.</p><p><strong>Comparison of results: Identifying censorship</strong></p><p>Once the above steps of the web connectivity test are performed <em>both</em>
over a control server and over the network of the user, the collected
results are then compared with the aim of identifying whether and how
tested websites are tampered with. If the compared results do <em>not</em>
match, then there is a sign of network interference.</p><p>Below are the conditions under which the following types of blocking are
identified:</p><ul><li><p><strong>DNS blocking:</strong> If the DNS responses (such as the IP addresses mapped to host names) do <em>not</em> match.</p></li><li><p><strong>TCP/IP blocking:</strong> If a TCP session to connect to websites was <em>not</em> established over the network of the user.</p></li><li><p><strong>HTTP blocking:</strong> If the HTTP request over the user‚Äôs network failed, or the HTTP status codes don‚Äôt match, or all of the following apply:</p><ul><li><p>The body length of compared websites (over the control server
and the network of the user) differs by some percentage</p></li><li><p>The HTTP headers names do not match</p></li><li><p>The HTML title tags do not match</p></li></ul></li></ul><p>It‚Äôs important to note, however, that DNS resolvers, such as Google or a
local ISP, often provide users with IP addresses that are closest to
them geographically. Often this is <em>not</em> done with the intent of network
tampering, but merely for the purpose of providing users with localized
content or faster access to websites. As a result, some false positives
might arise in OONI measurements. Other false positives might occur when
tested websites serve different content depending on the country that
the user is connecting from, or in the cases when websites return
failures even though they are not tampered with.</p><h3 id=http-invalid-request-line-test>HTTP Invalid Request Line test</h3><p>This
<a href=https://github.com/TheTorProject/ooni-probe/blob/master/ooni/nettests/manipulation/http_invalid_request_line.py>test</a>
tries to detect the presence of network components (‚Äúmiddle box‚Äù) which
could be responsible for censorship and/or traffic manipulation.</p><p>Instead of sending a normal HTTP request, this test sends an invalid
HTTP request line - containing an invalid HTTP version number, an
invalid field count and a huge request method ‚Äì to an echo service
listening on the standard HTTP port. An echo service is a very useful
debugging and measurement tool, which simply sends back to the
originating source any data it receives. If a middle box is not present
in the network between the user and an echo service, then the echo
service will send the invalid HTTP request line back to the user,
exactly as it received it. In such cases, there is no visible traffic
manipulation in the tested network.</p><p>If, however, a middle box is present in the tested network, the invalid
HTTP request line will be intercepted by the middle box and this may
trigger an error and that will subsequently be sent back to OONI‚Äôs
server. Such errors indicate that software for traffic manipulation is
likely placed in the tested network, though it‚Äôs not always clear what
that software is. In some cases though, censorship and/or surveillance
vendors can be identified through the error messages in the received
HTTP response. Based on this technique, OONI has previously

<a href=https://github.com/TheTorProject/ooni-probe/blob/master/ooni/nettests/manipulation/http_header_field_manipulation.py>test</a>
also tries to detect the presence of network components (‚Äúmiddle box‚Äù)
which could be responsible for censorship and/or traffic manipulation.</p><p>HTTP is a protocol which transfers or exchanges data across the
internet. It does so by handling a client‚Äôs request to connect to a
server, and a server‚Äôs response to a client‚Äôs request. Every time a user
connects to a server, the user (client) sends a request through the HTTP
protocol to that server. Such requests include ‚ÄúHTTP headers‚Äù, which
transmit various types of information, including the user‚Äôs device
operating system and the type of browser that is being used. If Firefox
is used on Windows, for example, the ‚Äúuser agent header‚Äù in the HTTP
request will tell the server that a Firefox browser is being used on a
Windows operating system.</p><p>This test emulates an HTTP request towards a server, but sends HTTP
headers that have variations in capitalization. In other words, this
test sends HTTP requests which include valid, but non-canonical HTTP
headers. Such requests are sent to a backend control server which sends
back any data it receives. If OONI receives the HTTP headers exactly as
they were sent, then there is no visible presence of a ‚Äúmiddle box‚Äù in
the network that could be responsible for censorship, surveillance
and/or traffic manipulation. If, however, such software is present in
the tested network, it will likely normalize the invalid headers that
are sent or add extra headers.</p><p>Depending on whether the HTTP headers that are sent and received from a
backend control server are the same or not, OONI is able to evaluate
whether software ‚Äì which could be responsible for traffic manipulation ‚Äì
is present in the tested network.</p><p>False negatives, however, could potentially occur in the hypothetical
instance that ISPs are using highly sophisticated software that is
specifically designed to not interfere with HTTP headers when it
receives them. Furthermore, the presence of a middle box is not
necessarily indicative of traffic manipulation, as they are often used
in networks for caching purposes.</p><h3 id=vanilla-tor-test>Vanilla Tor test</h3><p>This

measurements, including the following types of data:</p><p><strong>Country code</strong></p><p>OONI by default records the country users are running OONI Probe tests
from, by automatically resolving the user‚Äôs IP address with the
<a href=https://www.maxmind.com/en/home>MaxMind GeoIP database</a>. The
collection of country codes is an important part of OONI‚Äôs research, as
they enable OONI to map out global network measurements and to identify
where network interference takes place.</p><p><strong>Autonomous System Number (ASN)</strong></p><p>OONI also collects the Autonomous System Number (ASN) which corresponds
to the network or ISP that a user is in. The collection of the ASN is
useful to OONI‚Äôs research because it reveals the specific network
provider (such as Vodafone) of a user. This information can increase
transparency in regards to which network providers are implementing
censorship or other forms of network interference.</p><p><strong>Date and time of measurements</strong></p><p>OONI by default collects the time and date of when tests were run. This
information helps OONI evaluate when network interferences occur and to
compare them across time.</p><p><strong>IP addresses and other information</strong></p><p>OONI does <em>not</em> deliberately collect or store users‚Äô IP addresses. In
fact, OONI takes measures to remove users‚Äô IP addresses from collected
measurements, to protect its users from <a href=https://ooni.org/about/risks/>potential risks</a>.</p><p>However, OONI might <em>unintentionally</em> collect users‚Äô IP addresses and
other potentially personally-identifiable information, if that
information is included in the HTTP headers or other metadata of
measurements. This, for example, can occur if tested websites include
tracking technologies or custom content based on a user‚Äôs network
location.</p><p><strong>Network measurements</strong></p><p>The types of network measurements that OONI collects depend on the types
of tests that are run. Specifications about each OONI test can be viewed
through its <a href=https://github.com/TheTorProject/ooni-spec/tree/master/test-specs>git repository</a>,
and collected network measurements can be viewed through <a href=https://explorer.ooni.org/world/>OONI Explorer</a> or through
OONI‚Äôs <a href=https://api.ooni.io/>measurement API</a>.</p><p>OONI processes reports with the aim of deriving meaning from data and,
specifically, to answer the following types of questions:</p><ul><li><p>Which types of OONI tests were run?</p></li><li><p>In which countries were those tests run?</p></li><li><p>In which networks were those tests run?</p></li><li><p>When were tests run?</p></li><li><p>What types of network interference occurred?</p></li><li><p>In which countries did network interference occur?</p></li><li><p>In which networks did network interference occur?</p></li><li><p>When did network interference occur?</p></li><li><p>How did network interference occur?</p></li></ul><p>To answer these questions, OONI‚Äôs pipeline is designed to process data
which is automatically sent to OONI‚Äôs measurement collector. The initial
processing of network measurements enables the following:</p><ul><li><p>Attributing measurements to a specific country.</p></li><li><p>Attributing measurements to a specific network within a country.</p></li><li><p>Distinguishing measurements based on the specific tests that were
run for their collection.</p></li><li><p>Distinguishing between ‚Äúnormal‚Äù and ‚Äúanomalous‚Äù measurements (the
latter indicating that a form of network tampering is likely present).</p></li><li><p>Identifying the type of network interference based on a set of
heuristics for DNS tampering, TCP/IP blocking, and HTTP blocking.</p></li><li><p>Identifying block pages based on a set of heuristics for
HTTP blocking.</p></li><li><p>Identifying the presence of ‚Äúmiddleboxes‚Äù within tested networks.</p></li></ul><p>However, false positives can emerge within the processed data due to a
number of reasons. As explained previously (section on ‚ÄúOONI network
measurements‚Äù), DNS resolvers (operated by Google or a local ISP) often
provide users with IP addresses that are closest to them geographically.
While this may appear to be a case of DNS tampering, it is actually done
with the intention of providing users with faster access to websites.
Similarly, false positives may emerge when tested websites serve
different content depending on the country that the user is connecting
from, or in the cases when websites return failures even though they are
not tampered with.</p><p>Measurements indicating HTTP or TCP/IP blocking might actually be due to
temporary HTTP or TCP/IP failures, and may not conclusively indicate
network interference. It is therefore important to test the same
websites across time and to cross-correlate data, prior to concluding
that they are in fact being blocked.</p><p>Since block pages differ from country to country and sometimes even from
network to network, it can be challenging to accurately identify them.
OONI uses a series of heuristics to decide if a response differs from
the expected control, but these heuristics can fail. For this reason,
OONI only says that there is a confirmed instance of blocking when a
block page is positively detected.</p><p>OONI‚Äôs methodology for detecting the presence of ‚Äúmiddleboxes‚Äù - systems
that could be responsible for censorship, surveillance and traffic
manipulation - can also present false negatives, if ISPs are using
highly sophisticated software that is specifically designed to <em>not</em>
interfere with HTTP headers when it receives them, or to <em>not</em> trigger
error messages when receiving invalid HTTP request lines. It remains
unclear though if such software is being used. Moreover, it‚Äôs important
to note that the presence of a middle box is not necessarily indicative
of censorship or traffic manipulation, as such systems are often used in
networks for caching purposes.</p><p>Upon collection of more network measurements, OONI continues to develop
its data analysis heuristics, based on which it attempts to accurately
identify censorship events.</p><h1 id=findings>Findings</h1><p>Thousands of network measurements
<a href=https://api.ooni.io/files/by_country/IR>collected</a>
from 60 local networks over the last three years reveal <em>pervasive</em>
levels of internet censorship in Iran.</p><p>We confirm the <strong>blocking of 886 unique domains</strong> (and of 1,019 URLs in
total) due to the presence of block pages. Some Iranian ISPs served
block pages through DNS injection, while others used HTTP transparent
proxies to serve block pages.</p><p>Internet censorship in Iran does <em>not</em> appear to be deterministic. We
noticed that various ISPs would block sites inconsistently across time,
possibly creating public uncertainty on whether sites were in fact
blocked or not. As such, some of the blocked domains presented in this
study have been blocked and unblocked in various moments across time
over the last three years.</p><p>Most of the blocked domains include news outlets and human rights sites,
as illustrated in the graph below.</p><p><img src=/post/iran/graph.png alt="Graph: Blocked domains in Iran"></p><p>We have characterised the levels of internet censorship in Iran as
‚Äúpervasive‚Äù because we found a large portion of content falling under
many categories to be blocked. The above graph illustrates that internet
censorship in Iran is not restricted to illegal forms of content (such
as pornography, gambling, hate speech, alcohol and drugs), but also
extends to a broad range of other types of content, such as news
outlets, human rights sites, blogging platforms, online social networks,
communication tools, anonymity and censorship circumvention tools, and
search engines, amongst others.</p><p>Our tests examining the reachability of instant messaging apps revealed
the <a href=https://explorer.ooni.org/measurement/20170829T024145Z_AS44244_PLe6uPURhuUA87xoPzzcFU69idfuiVs4jAEqj5E7r5i2BtK2cS>DNS blocking of Facebook Messenger</a>

across many networks in Iran, which might be responsible for internet

find that the domains of multiple popular circumvention tool sites (such

are <a href=https://explorer.ooni.org/country/IR>blocked</a>. We
also find that the <a href=https://www.torproject.org/>Tor anonymity network</a> is

in many networks, as revealed by <a href=https://ooni.org/nettest/vanilla-tor/>OONI‚Äôs test</a> designed to
measure the reachability to the Tor network. Many Iranian ISPs block
both the HTTP and HTTPS versions of sites, while others even <a href="https://explorer.ooni.org/measurement/20170829T230553Z_AS16322_FzDNrDAXLoliG9WJQdIRlSWUvWRSH7hErmPzUgGaNKTqqQ8YLa?input=http:%2F%2Fwww.systranbox.com">block online translators</a>
as an additional method of limiting circumvention.</p><p>Therefore, internet censorship in Iran is not only pervasive in terms of
its breadth, but it is also in how it is implemented. The breadth and
scale of censorship also suggests a high level of surveillance, since
knowing what to block requires prior knowledge of what people are
accessing (or could be accessing).</p><p>The government is not the only source of internet censorship in Iran. We
found that

and multiple other types of Israeli sites. The fact that the blocking of
Israeli domains is not limited to those that express criticism towards
the Iranian government or which host illegal content suggests that

indicates that politics likely influence how information controls are

Over the last decades, Iranian authorities have exhibited limited
tolerance when domestic issues are surfaced on the international agenda.
The <a href=http://www.economist.com/node/11707464>imprisonment of Ahmad Batebi</a>, an Iranian activist
who brought (more) international attention to human rights violations in
Iran when he appeared on the cover of The Economist, is an example of
this. Human Rights Watch has routinely been
<a href=https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2017/country-chapters/iran>reporting</a>
on human rights violations in Iran, highlighting executions, torture,
and the ill-treatment of minorities, and defending political prisoners
and women‚Äôs rights. Therefore, the motivation behind the blocking of
such sites might be attributed to their coverage of incidents that
Iranian authorities may have incentive to conceal, and/or because they
may be viewed as overly critical or inaccurate by authorities.</p><p>It‚Äôs worth emphasizing though that other major human rights sites - such
as <a href=https://www.amnesty.org/>Amnesty International</a> - which <em>also</em>
<a href=https://www.amnesty.org/en/countries/middle-east-and-north-africa/iran/report-iran/>report on human rights violations in Iran</a>,
were found to be

in Iran. The fact that Amnesty‚Äôs site was found to be accessible is
particularly interesting because the organization has <a href=https://www.amnesty.org/en/press-releases/2008/07/iran-end-discrimination-against-kurdish-minority-20080730/>not been permitted to investigate human rights in Iran</a>
over the last decades.</p><p><strong>Religious and ethnic minorities</strong></p><p>According to international human rights organizations, such as <a href=https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2017/country-chapters/iran#72cd39>Human Rights Watch</a>
and <a href=https://www.amnesty.org/en/countries/middle-east-and-north-africa/iran/report-iran/>Amnesty International</a>,
religious and ethnic minorities in Iran have been victims of
discrimination.</p><p>The Kurds are the <a href=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ir.html>third largest ethnic group</a>
in Iran. Amnesty has
<a href=https://www.amnesty.org/en/press-releases/2008/07/iran-end-discrimination-against-kurdish-minority-20080730/>reported</a>
that while expression of Kurdish culture (such as dress and music) has
generally been respected, the Kurdish minority in Iran continues to
experience deep-rooted discrimination. Since 1918, there has been an
ongoing <a href=https://web.archive.org/web/20120615011857/http://government.arts.cornell.edu/assets/psac/sp09/Smith_Kurdish_Separatism_Feb09_PSAC.pdf>separatist dispute</a>
between the Kurdish opposition in western Iran and the Iranian
government. Kurdish ethnic rights defenders Farzad Kamangar, Ali
Heydariyan and Farhad Vakili were <a href=https://editorials.voa.gov/a/a-41-2008-09-26-voa1-84649927/1480484.html>sentenced to death in 2008</a>,
following what Amnesty
<a href=https://www.amnesty.org/en/press-releases/2008/07/iran-end-discrimination-against-kurdish-minority-20080730/>called</a>
a ‚Äúgrossly flawed‚Äù judicial process. Many other Kurdish human rights
defenders, community activists and journalists have <a href=https://www.amnesty.org/en/press-releases/2008/07/iran-end-discrimination-against-kurdish-minority-20080730/>faced arbitrary arrests and prosecution</a>.

with the Kurdish separatist movement and the fact that such sites report
on human rights violations against the Kurds, these censorship events
may attempt to reinforce geopolitical dynamics of power.</p><p>Religious minorities have faced discrimination in Iran as well. Iran‚Äôs
Baha‚Äôi population - the country‚Äôs largest religious minority - has
<a href=http://www.bahai.com/thebahais/pg59.htm>systemically faced prosecution</a> by authorities
over the last century. Following the contested 2009 elections, Human
Rights Watch
<a href=https://www.hrw.org/news/2010/02/23/iran-end-persecution-bahais>argued</a>
that Iranian authorities targeted the Baha‚Äôi community as a cover for
the post-election unrest. In late 2016, at least <a href=https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2017/country-chapters/iran#72cd39>85 Baha‚Äôis were imprisoned</a>
and <a href=https://www.amnesty.org/en/countries/middle-east-and-north-africa/iran/report-iran/>allegations of torture</a>
surfaced for various other members of the Baha‚Äôi community. In addition
to being persecuted for practising their faith, the minority has also
been
<a href=https://www.amnesty.org/en/countries/middle-east-and-north-africa/iran/report-iran/>discriminated</a>
in terms of education, employment, and inheritance.</p><p>As part of this study, we found various Baha‚Äôi sites to be blocked.

techniques. The example below shows that, in some cases, Aria Shatel
(AS31549) censored bbc.com through the DNS injection of a block page,
while in other cases it used an HTTP transparent proxy to serve a block
page for the same site. The ISP also lifted the block on at least one
occasion.</p><table><thead><tr><th>probe_asn</th><th>domain</th><th>calc_blockpage</th><th>count</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>AS31549</td><td><code>bbc.com</code></td><td>dns-blk-0</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>AS31549</td><td><code>bbc.com</code></td><td>ir-iframe-1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>AS31549</td><td><code>bbc.com</code></td><td>dns-blk-0</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>AS31549</td><td><code>bbc.com</code></td><td>ir-iframe-1</td><td>16</td></tr><tr><td>AS31549</td><td><code>bbc.com</code></td><td>ir-iframe-1</td><td>15</td></tr><tr><td>AS31549</td><td><code>bbc.com</code></td><td>not-blocked</td><td>1</td></tr></tbody></table><p>While in some cases ISPs mostly blocked certain sites
and only lifted blocks occasionally, in other cases we found the
opposite to be true. Google‚Äôs example below is quite interesting because
it shows that most of the time, the search engine appears to be
accessible. In this case, Aria Shatel only served a block page for
google.com a few times, possibly in an attempt to make the censorship
less noticeable.</p><table><thead><tr><th>probe_asn</th><th>domain</th><th>calc_blockpage</th><th>count</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>AS31549</td><td><code>google.com</code></td><td>not-blocked</td><td>15</td></tr><tr><td>AS31549</td><td><code>google.com</code></td><td>not-blocked</td><td>18</td></tr><tr><td>AS31549</td><td><code>google.com</code></td><td>not-blocked</td><td>19</td></tr><tr><td>AS31549</td><td><code>google.com</code></td><td>ir-iframe-1</td><td>18</td></tr><tr><td>AS31549</td><td><code>google.com</code></td><td>not-blocked</td><td>18</td></tr><tr><td>AS31549</td><td><code>google.com</code></td><td>not-blocked</td><td>17</td></tr><tr><td>AS31549</td><td><code>google.com</code></td><td>ir-iframe-1</td><td>19</td></tr><tr><td>AS31549</td><td><code>google.com</code></td><td>not-blocked</td><td>16</td></tr><tr><td>AS31549</td><td><code>google.com</code></td><td>not-blocked</td><td>18</td></tr><tr><td>AS31549</td><td><code>google.com</code></td><td>ir-iframe-1</td><td>19</td></tr><tr><td>AS31549</td><td><code>google.com</code></td><td>not-blocked</td><td>17</td></tr><tr><td>AS31549</td><td><code>google.com</code></td><td>not-blocked</td><td>19</td></tr><tr><td>AS31549</td><td><code>google.com</code></td><td>not-blocked</td><td>18</td></tr><tr><td>AS31549</td><td><code>google.com</code></td><td>not-blocked</td><td>17</td></tr><tr><td>AS31549</td><td><code>google.com</code></td><td>not-blocked</td><td>18</td></tr><tr><td>AS31549</td><td><code>google.com</code></td><td>not-blocked</td><td>18</td></tr><tr><td>AS31549</td><td><code>google.com</code></td><td>not-blocked</td><td>18</td></tr><tr><td>AS31549</td><td><code>google.com</code></td><td>ir-iframe-1</td><td>19</td></tr><tr><td>AS31549</td><td><code>google.com</code></td><td>not-blocked</td><td>18</td></tr><tr><td>AS31549</td><td><code>google.com</code></td><td>not-blocked</td><td>17</td></tr><tr><td>AS31549</td><td><code>google.com</code></td><td>ir-iframe-1</td><td>18</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Quite similarly, viber.com (a popular communications tool in Iran) was
only found to be blocked once by Aria Shatel (though more times by other
Iranian ISPs). This may suggest that some ISPs in Iran might take social
pressure into account, thus limiting the blocking of popular platforms
and/or making such censorship more subtle. This is also indicated by the
fact that we found

includes an analysis of <a href=https://api.ooni.io/files/by_country/IR>thousands of network measurements</a>
that were collected from 60 vantage points in Iran over the last three
years, between 22nd September 2014 to 4th September 2017. Censorship
events that may have occurred before and/or after the testing period are
not analysed as part of this study.</p><p>Another limitation is associated to the amount and types of URLs that
were tested for censorship. As mentioned in the methodology section of
this report, OONI‚Äôs <a href=https://ooni.org/nettest/web-connectivity/>Web Connectivity test</a> was run to
examine the accessibility of
<a href=https://github.com/citizenlab/test-lists/blob/master/lists/ir.csv>894 URLs</a>
that are more relevant to the Iranian context and <a href=https://github.com/citizenlab/test-lists/blob/master/lists/global.csv>1,107 internationally relevant sites</a>.
All of these URLs were selected and categorized in collaboration with
community members over the last years. We acknowledge that some URLs
might potentially be mis-categorized, the selection of URLs may have
been biased, and that the testing sample of URLs might exclude many
other sites that are also blocked in Iran. We therefore encourage
researchers and community members to continue <a href=https://ooni.org/get-involved/contribute-test-lists/>reviewing and contributing to these test lists</a>,
to help improve future research and analysis.</p><p>Finally, while network measurements were collected from 60 different
networks in Iran, <a href=https://github.com/TheTorProject/ooni-probe>OONI‚Äôs software tests</a> were not run
consistently across all networks. Stable measurements were collected
from certain vantage points throughout the testing period, but less
stable measurements were also collected from a number of other vantage
points.</p><h1 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h1><p>This study reveals and confirms censorship events in Iran through the
analysis of <a href=https://api.ooni.io/files/by_country/IR>thousands of network measurements</a>
that were collected from 60 local vantage points in Iran over the last
three years. The network measurement data clearly shows how ISPs blocked
sites and services and can therefore serve as <strong>evidence of information
controls</strong> in Iran.</p><p>Our main conclusions from this study are summarized below.</p><ol><li><p><strong>The breadth and scale of internet censorship in Iran is pervasive</strong>. We found a wide range of <a href=/post/iran/ir-blocked-urls.csv>different types of sites to be blocked</a> (expanding beyond those that are illegal). Blocked domains include many news outlets and human rights sites, as well as blogging platforms, communication tools, online social networks, media sharing platforms, search engines, gaming sites, governmental sites, cultural and entertainment sites, amongst many other types of sites.</p></li><li><p><strong>Iranian ISPs appear to be enforcing a type of ‚Äúintranet‚Äù through censorship.</strong> By blocking access to popular international sites (such as <a href="https://explorer.ooni.org/measurement/20170829T230553Z_AS16322_FzDNrDAXLoliG9WJQdIRlSWUvWRSH7hErmPzUgGaNKTqqQ8YLa?input=https:%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com">youtube.com</a>, <a href="https://explorer.ooni.org/measurement/20170904T034357Z_AS44244_tzAvg8gW5NamMwMUsVje7zudbDz1AkyFzCe3A4evLHXoYMFztM?input=https:%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fkambizhosseini">facebook.com</a>, and <a href="https://explorer.ooni.org/measurement/20170831T111030Z_AS44244_mV6lnlrp0UDTtLHJBpeBApNkkmKQQqy13siWac0qZPPpmJis9G?input=https:%2F%2Ftwitter.com">twitter.com</a>), Iranian ISPs appear to be creating a sort of ‚Äú<em>intranet‚Äù</em> since non-censored internet activity appears to largely be limited to government-approved sites and services.</p></li><li><p><strong>Internet censorship in Iran is quite sophisticated.</strong> (1) Iranian ISPs were found to serve block pages through DNS injection <em>and</em> through the use of HTTP transparent proxies. (2) We found ISPs to be blocking the same sites with different techniques (Aria Shatel, for example, served <a href="https://explorer.ooni.org/measurement/20170623T002641Z_AS31549_VVYnsqIsyeuH6LJhOh4zuG11SDZvMsb5CobOyfLEXgj3VDhbBI?input=http:%2F%2Fwww.bbc.com%2Fnews">block pages for bbc.com through DNS injection</a> and <a href="https://explorer.ooni.org/measurement/20170328T083801Z_AS31549_eFpUdEKswulxmus8kWISa4glA8BWvPPjUOp0DJu7uKknS74Zwx?input=http:%2F%2Fwww.bbc.com%2Fnews">HTTP transparent proxies</a>). (3) ISPs were found to block both the HTTP and HTTPS versions of sites, making censorship circumvention harder. (4) Internet censorship is <em>reinforced</em> through the extensive blocking of popular censorship circumvention tools (which is not limited to domains, but expands to the <a href=https://explorer.ooni.org/measurement/20170808T004237Z_AS197207_yysdxIa15WjQ3pQFt9RLxQc2lRzWFlxQKoQXd6846BUbEYw5gr>blocking of the Tor network</a>). (5) ISPs were found to <a href="https://explorer.ooni.org/measurement/20160728T203537Z_AS31549_cVUwVULt6ZlIiKUzZ1e1ypGVoaUDcHgE4BaHngboTgataWCFWX?input=http:%2F%2Ftranslator.babylon.com">*block online translators</a>, possibly as an <em>extra step</em> to limit censorship circumvention.</p></li><li><p><strong>Shift from ‚Äúsmart filters‚Äù to ‚Äúblanket censorship‚Äù?</strong> A few years ago, when sites like Instagram did not support HTTPS, it was <a href=https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/4x38kd/irans-smart-instagram-censorship-isnt-that-smart>reported</a> that Iranian ISPs only censored certain webpages, rather than blocking access to entire sites. Now, however, we are seeing that Iranian ISPs are <a href="https://explorer.ooni.org/measurement/20170829T230553Z_AS16322_FzDNrDAXLoliG9WJQdIRlSWUvWRSH7hErmPzUgGaNKTqqQ8YLa?input=https:%2F%2Fwww.instagram.com%2F">also blocking the HTTPS version of sites</a>, since it‚Äôs not possible to limit censorship to specific webpages when a site is hosted on HTTPS. This indicates that Iranian ISPs may have shifted their practices from applying ‚Äúsmart filters‚Äù (only censoring specific webpages) to a form of ‚Äúblanket censorship‚Äù (censoring entire sites).</p></li><li><p><strong>Internet censorship in Iran appears to be centralised.</strong> This is strongly suggested by the fact that we found <em>consistency</em> in terms of how internet censorship was implemented across networks. ISPs were not only found to be blocking the same sites, but they were also found to be using the same set of censorship techniques.</p></li><li><p><strong>Internet censorship in Iran is non-deterministic.</strong> ISPs in Iran do <em>not</em> appear to block sites consistently across time. Rather, they were found to filp between blocking and unblocking sites, possibly in an attempt to create uncertainty on whether a site is actually censored or to make the censorship more subtle. Interestingly enough, ISPs were found to block some of the more popular sites (such as <a href="https://explorer.ooni.org/measurement/20170913T033941Z_AS44244_XWbJUSF7A1sEQXM6OyeVxUcXFkHlsSJ8WRc2q7nCBkBYDvjph0?input=http:%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2Fsearch%3Fhl%3Dar%26q%3DKoon%26btnG%3D%25D8%25A5%25D8%25A8%25D8%25AD%25D8%25AB%2521%26lr%3D">google.com</a>) less frequently in comparison to less popular sites. This may suggest a political and/or social cost to censorship, which might be taken into account.</p></li><li><p><strong>Political relations influence how information controls are implemented in Iran.</strong> This is strongly suggested by the fact that Iranian ISPs were found to block multiple <a href="https://explorer.ooni.org/measurement/20170906T030515Z_AS197207_RzGkAOX5mI1Gqp0GlODyuGNCgoyrt9pLHsyaVGIV5rol1tmD3Q?input=http:%2F%2Fwww.mod.gov.il">Israeli</a> and <a href="https://explorer.ooni.org/measurement/20170829T230553Z_AS16322_FzDNrDAXLoliG9WJQdIRlSWUvWRSH7hErmPzUgGaNKTqqQ8YLa?input=https:%2F%2Fwww.cia.gov">U.S. domains</a>.
