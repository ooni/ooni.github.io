capacity to support the internet freedom community in investigating
internet censorship over the next years.</p><p>In 2022, we had the opportunity to serve as the host organization for
three <strong>OTF Information Controls Research Fellows</strong>: <a href=https://www.opentech.fund/about/people/ain-ghazal/>Ain Ghazal</a>,
<a href=https://www.opentech.fund/about/people/gurshabad-grover/>Gurshabad Grover</a>, and
<a href=https://www.opentech.fund/about/people/kathrin-elmenhorst/>Kathrin Elmenhorst</a>.
Throughout their 1-year research fellowships with OONI, Ain designed
methods for measuring VPN blocking, while Gurshabad studied the legal
and technical infrastructure of censorship in Asia. During her 3-month
research fellowship with OONI, Kathrin investigated HTTP/3 censorship
and published a <a href=https://ooni.org/post/2022-quick-look-quic-censorship/>blog post</a> sharing
her findings.</p><p>During the summer of 2022, we also had the opportunity to host two
<strong>Google Summer of Code (GSoC) students</strong>: Germa Vinsmoke and Mehul
Gulati. Germa worked on <a href=https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2022/projects/EMOQ4Zai>OONI Explorer and Design System improvements</a>,
while Mehul worked on <a href=https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2022/projects/GAEEQk5w>OONI Probe network experiments</a>.</p><p>In early November 2022, we hosted the first <strong>in-person OONI Team
Meeting</strong> (in Rome, Italy) since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.
During this 3-day meeting, we improved our roadmaps and discussed
strategic priorities and implementation details for many new systems
we’ll be building over the next few years.</p><h1 id=ooni-probe>OONI Probe</h1><h2 id=new-ooni-probe-experiments>New OONI Probe experiments</h2><div><a href=/post/ooni-in-2022/images/02.png><img src=/post/ooni-in-2022/images/02_hu248836734061981058.png></a></div><p>In 2022, we shipped the following new experiments:</p><ul><li><p><a href=https://ooni.org/nettest/tor-snowflake/>Tor Snowflake</a></p></li><li><p><a href=https://ooni.org/nettest/vanilla-tor/>Vanilla Tor</a></p></li><li><p><a href=https://github.com/ooni/spec/blob/master/nettests/ts-028-dnscheck.md>DNS Check</a></p></li></ul><p>You can run these experiments through the <a href=https://ooni.org/install>OONI Probe</a> apps. The <a href=https://ooni.org/nettest/tor-snowflake/>Tor Snowflake</a> experiment provides
an automated way of measuring whether the <a href=https://snowflake.torproject.org/>Tor Snowflake pluggable transport</a> works on a tested
network, while the <a href=https://ooni.org/nettest/vanilla-tor/>Vanilla Tor</a> experiment measures the
reachability of the <a href=https://www.torproject.org/>Tor network</a>. Our
<a href=https://github.com/ooni/spec/blob/master/nettests/ts-028-dnscheck.md>DNS Check</a>
experiment measures the reachability of encrypted DNS (DoH/DoT)
services, and has been used to support <a href=https://ooni.org/post/2022-doh-dot-paper-dnsprivacy21/>research on DoH/DoT blocking</a> in
Kazakhstan, Iran, and China.</p><p>We also designed several other experiments (including <a href=https://github.com/ooni/spec/blob/master/nettests/ts-035-dnsping.md>DNS Ping</a>,
<a href=https://github.com/ooni/spec/blob/master/nettests/ts-032-tcpping.md>TCP Ping</a>,

and <a href=https://github.com/ooni/spec/blob/master/nettests/ts-034-simplequicping.md>simple QUIC Ping</a>)
and we made numerous, significant <a href="https://github.com/ooni/probe/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+label%3A%22data+quality%22">data quality improvements</a>.</p><p>Notably, we designed <a href=https://github.com/bassosimone/websteps-illustrated/>new methods</a> to
improve how we measure website blocking. Our new methods enumerate all
forms of website blocking, including support for HTTP/3, enabling the
collection of richer data. We aim to incrementally ship these new
methods as part of our <a href=https://ooni.org/nettest/web-connectivity/>Web Connectivity</a> experiment
over the next year.</p><h2 id=new-test-lists-editor>New Test Lists Editor</h2><div><a href=/post/ooni-in-2022/images/03.png><img src=/post/ooni-in-2022/images/03_hu5181621036454891939.png></a></div><p>In July 2022, we
<a href=https://ooni.org/post/2022-test-lists-editor/>launched</a> a new <a href=https://test-lists.ooni.org/>Test Lists Editor</a>! This platform enables the
public to <strong>review and contribute to the lists of websites</strong> (“<a href=https://ooni.org/get-involved/contribute-test-lists>test lists</a>”) that are
tested for censorship by <a href=https://ooni.org/install/>OONI Probe</a> users
around the world.</p><p>Through this <a href=https://test-lists.ooni.org/>web platform</a>, community
members can add websites for <a href=https://ooni.org/install>OONI Probe</a>
testing, edit existing entries (for example, to change a website’s
categorization or to update a URL), or propose the deletion of URLs. By
enabling community members to dynamically contribute to and update the
<a href=https://ooni.org/support/faq#what-are-test-lists>test lists</a>, we aim
to improve the quality of website censorship testing, supporting rapid
response efforts to emergent censorship events.</p><h2 id=ooni-run-improvements>OONI Run improvements</h2><div><a href=/post/ooni-in-2022/images/04.png><img src=/post/ooni-in-2022/images/04_hu14011603811192421547.png></a></div><p>Based on <a href=https://ooni.org/post/2020-06-09-ooni-run-usability-study-findings/>community feedback</a>,
we made a series of improvements to <a href=https://run.ooni.io/>OONI Run</a>:
a platform that you can use to generate mobile deep links and widget
code to coordinate <a href=https://ooni.org/install>OONI Probe</a> testing. We
limited the <a href=https://run.ooni.io/>OONI Run</a> platform to website
testing and we made improvements to the user interface.</p><p>To meet the needs of researchers performing custom testing, we designed
and <a href=https://github.com/ooni/probe-cli/pull/844>implemented a minimal version of the next generation version</a> of OONI Run
(“<a href=https://github.com/ooni/spec/pull/249>OONI Run v2</a>”) that enables
community members to run OONI Run links without backend support. We made
this <a href=https://github.com/ooni/probe/issues/2184>functionality</a>
available to
<a href=https://github.com/ooni/probe-engine/tree/master/cmd/miniooni>miniooni</a>
users with the goal of enabling community members to start experimenting
with this new OONI Run version and collect feedback that can support
further development and design decisions. We also <a href=https://github.com/ooni/probe-cli/pull/819>introduced a command line flag</a> which enables
users to repeat a measurement every given number of seconds.</p><p>We aim to continue to make improvements to OONI Run over the next year
to further address <a href=https://ooni.org/post/2020-06-09-ooni-run-usability-study-findings/>community feedback</a>.</p><h2 id=ooni-probe-web-prototype>OONI Probe Web prototype</h2><div><a href=/post/ooni-in-2022/images/05.png><img src=/post/ooni-in-2022/images/05_hu13148007674841435011.png></a></div><p>In response to community requests, we built a browser-based version of
OONI Probe (“OONI Probe Web”). Given that OONI Probe Web does not
require the installation of software and can be run from a web browser,

blocking.</p><h2 id=advancing-ooni-data-analysis>Advancing OONI data analysis</h2><p>In 2022, we created a <a href=https://github.com/ooni/data>new data analysis tool</a> for exposing anomaly details of
website measurements and characterizing website blocking. Some of the
building blocks for designing this tool were applied in practice as part
of our investigation into <a href=https://ooni.org/post/2022-russia-blocks-amid-ru-ua-conflict/>emergent website blocks in Russia</a>,
where we were able to <a href=https://ooni.org/post/2022-russia-blocks-amid-ru-ua-conflict/#blocked-website-about-captured-and-killed-russian-soldiers>characterize the blocking methods across ISPs</a>.</p><p>The <a href=https://github.com/ooni/data#architecture-overview>high level architecture</a> of
this new data analysis tool is that of transforming the raw network
measurements coming from OONI Probes into normalized and post-processed
“<a href=https://github.com/ooni/data#observation-generation>Observations</a>”.
These Observations are “time stamped” statements about some network
condition that was observed by a particular vantage point. These
observations are then in turn post-processed to generate what we call an
“<a href=https://github.com/ooni/data#experimentresult-generation>Experiment result</a>”,
which attributes to a set of observations from an individual test run a
series of outcomes with an associated level of confidence.</p><p>In order to reach a design that would be flexible enough to be expanded,
but also performant enough to run in a reasonable amount of time, we
<a href=https://github.com/ooni/data/pull/2>implemented</a>
<a href=https://github.com/ooni/data/pull/3>several</a> prototype
<a href=https://github.com/ooni/data/pull/1>iterations</a> of this
<a href=https://github.com/ooni/data/pull/15>design</a>. Throughout the process
we <a href=https://github.com/ooni/data/issues/4>carried out benchmarks</a> of
key components to identify any performance bottlenecks, working to
resolve them. The <a href=https://github.com/ooni/data/pull/17>last iteration</a>, based on some
<a href=https://github.com/ooni/data/pull/17#issue-1452100512>cursory benchmarks</a>,
should be able to generate observations from raw OONI measurements in
less than a week and re-generate all experiment results in about a day,
running on a single machine.</p><p>Through this <a href=https://github.com/ooni/data>data analysis tool</a> (which
anyone can <a href=https://github.com/ooni/data#developer-setup>run on their own computer</a> pointing it at
the <a href=https://ooni.org/data>raw public OONI dataset</a>), it’s possible
to gain a much deeper understanding about the root cause of a blocking
event, and to carry out more advanced research that might not be
captured by the existing analysis.</p><p>The new design is an important shift in how we view results from OONI
measurements and we are confident that it will allow us to characterize
blocks in a much richer way. It also opens the door for empowering

in the “Amnesty International Togo and Ors v. The Togolese
Republic” <a href=https://globalfreedomofexpression.columbia.edu/cases/amnesty-international-togo-and-ors-v-the-togolese-republic/>case</a>
that was brought to the Community Court of Justice of the Economic
Community of West African States (ECOWAS). In preparation for this
case, the OONI team was asked to share relevant technical
expertise, along with other experts. We analyzed the internet
shutdown and shared a <a href=https://twitter.com/FrancoisPatuel/status/1494030238388563968>technical analysis</a>
in support of the court case. As an outcome, the Community Court
of Justice of ECOWAS held that the Togolese government violated
the applicants’ right to freedom of expression by shutting down
the internet during protests in September 2017, and ordered the
Respondent State of Togo to take measures to guarantee the
“non-occurrence” of a future similar situation. The ECOWAS court
ruling on the September 2017 internet shutdown in Togo won the
Columbia University <a href=https://globalfreedomofexpression.columbia.edu/prizewinners2022/>Global Freedom of Expression 2022 Significant Legal Ruling Award</a>.</p></li></ul><p>We thank our community for their amazing efforts!</p><h1 id=2023>2023</h1><div><a href=/post/ooni-in-2022/images/13.png><img src=/post/ooni-in-2022/images/13_hu17693872733442949672.png></a></div><p>We have many exciting projects lined up for 2023!</p><p>Some highlights include:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Automating censorship detection and characterization based on OONI
measurements.</strong> We will expand our ability to automatically
confirm blocks based on fingerprints, and we will develop new
metrics for the automatic characterization of more forms of
internet censorship. This will build upon our work on our <a href=https://github.com/ooni/data>new data analysis tool</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>New Social Media Censorship Alert System.</strong> We are building a
system that the public can refer to in order to learn when and
where access to social media platforms is being blocked around the
world based on OONI data.</p></li><li><p><strong>New Censorship Incident Reporting Platform.</strong> This platform will
provide short reports with summary information on emergent
censorship events based on OONI data and charts, enabling
journalists and human rights defenders to more easily learn about
and respond to censorship events.</p></li><li><p><strong>New OONI Explorer pages.</strong> In 2023, we will publish new <a href=https://explorer.ooni.org/>OONI Explorer</a> pages that provide
domain-centric and network-centric views of OONI data. We will
also continue to make a series of improvements to <a href=https://explorer.ooni.org/>OONI Explorer</a> and the <a href=https://explorer.ooni.org/chart/mat>Measurement Aggregation Toolkit (MAT)</a>
based on community feedback. Our goal is to enable the internet
freedom community to more easily discover censorship findings
based on OONI data.</p></li><li><p><strong>New browser-based censorship measurement tool.</strong> In 2022, we
created OONI Probe Web to simplify the process of testing websites
during urgent censorship events. We aim to publicly launch OONI
Probe Web in 2023.</p></li><li><p><strong>New censorship measurement methodologies.</strong> We will continue to
expand OONI’s censorship measurement methodologies. This will
include working towards creating an open methodology for measuring
throttling, and expanding OONI’s testing model to support richer
testing input. We also aim to ship our <a href=https://github.com/bassosimone/websteps-illustrated/>new methods</a>
that advance how we measure website blocking.</p></li><li><p><strong>Improved version of OONI Run.</strong> We aim to release an improved
version of <a href=https://run.ooni.io/>OONI Run</a> (“<a href=https://github.com/ooni/spec/pull/249/files>OONI Run v2</a>”), addressing
key <a href=https://ooni.org/post/2020-06-09-ooni-run-usability-study-findings/>community feedback and needs</a>.
This will enable the internet freedom community to more
effectively coordinate censorship measurement campaigns and use
OONI data in support of their research and advocacy efforts.</p></li><li><p><strong>New and strengthened partnerships.</strong> Collaboration is key to
measuring and fighting internet censorship. In 2023, we aim to
strengthen our existing <a href=https://ooni.org/partners>partnerships</a>, and form new
partnerships with digital rights organizations around the world.</p></li><li><p><strong>New OONI Outreach Kit.</strong> To support OONI community engagement
efforts around the world, we aim to publish an OONI Outreach Kit
in 2023.</p></li><li><p><strong>New community resources.</strong> We aim to publish new documentation and
resources that can support OONI community engagement efforts
around the world. We also aim to publish translated versions of
our documents, and to strengthen our localization efforts.</p></li><li><p><strong>More research reports, workshops, and training.</strong> We will continue
to collaborate with community members on investigating censorship
events worldwide and documenting them through the publication of
<a href=https://ooni.org/reports/>research reports</a>. We will also
continue to engage communities through OONI workshops and training.</p></li></ul><p>Our above priorities for 2023 have been informed by community feedback
collected over the years (as well as in response to the dynamic
censorship environment worldwide). If there are additional areas that
you think we should prioritize, please don’t hesitate to <a href=https://ooni.org/about/#contact>let us know</a>.</p><p>If you would like to support our work, please consider <strong><a href=https://ooni.org/donate/>donating to OONI</a></strong>.</p><p>Warm thanks to the global OONI community for supporting our work
throughout 2022!</p><p>We are grateful to every <a href=https://ooni.org/install/>OONI Probe</a> user
out there, and we’re excited for 2023. Stay tuned!</p></main></div><footer class=p-4><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-12 col-md-4"><div class=pb-2><img src=/images/logos/ooni-horizontal.svg height=32px alt="OONI Logo"></div><div class=pb-4>Global community measuring internet censorship around the world.</div><div><div>© 2025 Open Observatory of Network Interference (OONI)</div><div><a href=https://github.com/ooni/license>Content available under a Creative Commons
