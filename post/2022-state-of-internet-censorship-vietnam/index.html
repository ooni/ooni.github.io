Internet censorship is one of the government methods for national security. In the first half of 2022, more than 293,000 measurements (2054 URLs) were collected including global test list and country test list. The number of country test lists is over 500 URLs (corresponding to more than 60,000 measurements) based on the selected URL test list. Of these, more than 300 URLs have been reported as blocked or inaccessible, mostly with political and human rights websites. Freedom of speech and the press in Vietnam appear to be restricted without improvement. Independent news outlets such as BBC, CNN, RFA, RFI, VOA have also been blocked in the past. VPN tools have become very popular in the country.</p><p>Under a joint study by the independent researchers in Vietnam and <a href=http://sinarproject.org/>Sinar Project</a> with support from <a href=https://ooni.org/>Open Observatory of Network Interference (OONI)</a>, this report aims to examine the current state of internet censorship in Vietnam by collecting and analysing network measurements to provide more transparency of internet controls in Vietnam.</p><p>The report is constructed in four parts. First, it provides information about Vietnam&rsquo;s network landscape, and internet penetration. Secondly, it discusses the legal environment on freedom of expression, access to information and privacy. The third part describes cases of censorship and surveillance reported in the country. The remainder of the report documents this study&rsquo;s methodology and key findings.</p><h2 id=background>Background</h2><p>Vietnam is a socialist republic country in Southeast Asia. It is a 100 million population country situated in a strategic location of the Indochina peninsula. The country is bordered to the North by China, to the West by Laos and Cambodia and a long coast to the East by the Eastern Sea (South China sea).</p><p>Vietnam is a multi-ethnic country, made up of 54 ethnic groups. The Kinh ethnic group accounted for 85.4% of the population, while the remaining 53 ethnic groups make up only 14.6%.<sup id=fnref:4><a href=#fn:4 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>4</a></sup> The majority of Vietnamese practices folk religions (45.3%), 16.4% of the population were Buddhists, 8.2% were Christians, and about 30% were unaffiliated to any religion.<sup id=fnref:5><a href=#fn:5 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>5</a></sup></p><p>Vietnam’s transformation from one of the world’s poorest countries in the 1980s to low middle-income status by 2010 is considered an economic success story. The Doi Moi reforms in 1986 led the country from a centralised economy to a liberalised and open market economy and focusing on a high level of foreign direct investment.<sup id=fnref:6><a href=#fn:6 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>6</a></sup> Since the 1990s, Vietnam has been one of the world’s fastest GDP growth rate countries, at 6.86% annually during 1990-2019,<sup id=fnref:7><a href=#fn:7 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>7</a></sup> lifting millions of people out of poverty. Even under the COVID-19 situation, Vietnam is predicted to be one of the few economies with strong resilience with positive growth in the coming period.<sup id=fnref:8><a href=#fn:8 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>8</a></sup></p><h3 id=political-landscape>Political Landscape</h3><p>The politics of Vietnam are dominated by a single party - the Communist Party of Vietnam (CPV). While the ideological orthodoxy of Communism has become less important over time, the country is still influenced strongly by the CPV. The General Secretary of the CPV is the supreme leader leading the communist party and is head of the Politburo and the Central Military Commission. At the same time, the President is the head of state, and the Prime Minister is the head of government. Executive power is exercised by the government and the state. Legislative power is vested in the National Assembly of Vietnam. The judiciary is independent of the executive.<sup id=fnref:9><a href=#fn:9 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>9</a></sup> However, the separation of powers among the executive, legislative and judiciary is weak. In addition, there is a far-reaching overlap between the CPV and the government, extending to the lower levels of the political system.<sup id=fnref:10><a href=#fn:10 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>10</a></sup></p><h3 id=legal-environment>Legal environment</h3><h4 id=freedom-of-the-press>Freedom of the press</h4><p>Freedom of the press is proclaimed in Article 19 of Vietnam’s Constitution, however, accompanied by articles that allow for the imprisonment of any news and information provider who proves troublesome to the government. Precisely, articles 109, 117, and 331 of the penal code specify anyone found guilty of “activities aimed at overthrowing the government”, “anti-state propaganda”, or “abusing the rights to freedom and democracy” can be sentenced to up to 20 years in prison.<sup id=fnref:11><a href=#fn:11 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>11</a></sup> In addition, Press Law No. 103/2016/QH13 governs the press, including citizens’ rights to freedom of press and freedom of speech in the press and the rights and obligations of agencies, organisations, and individuals involved in the media industry.</p><p>In practice, most news and media services are controlled by the state or have to follow the state’s orders. Independent bloggers and journalists are the only sources of freely reported news and information in a country; however, they are also strictly monitored, and many are put into jails. Facebook, Youtube and Zalo - a Vietnamese messaging app- are the most popular online platforms and currently serve as major tools for circulating news and information.<sup id=fnref:12><a href=#fn:12 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>12</a></sup></p><h4 id=access-to-information-law>Access to information law</h4><p>The Law on access to information was issued in 2016 and enacted in July 2018. This law is an important document detailing the people’s right to information access and State agencies’ information provision responsibility. While Vietnam has made significant steps to build the legal framework for the rights to information, there is still a long way toward effective implementation of the law at all levels and stakeholders. Most state agencies do not disclose how information can be requested, many local government employees have not been trained to process information requests, and not enough citizens have been made aware of their rights.<sup id=fnref:13><a href=#fn:13 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>13</a></sup></p><h4 id=privacy>Privacy</h4><p>Data privacy and security are mentioned in multiple government degrees and laws, including IT law 2006 (<a href="http://vbpl.vn/TW/Pages/vbpqen-toanvan.aspx?ItemID=4773">67/2006/QH11</a>), Consumer Protection Law 2010 (59/2010/QH12), Civil Code 2015 (91/2015/QH13), Cyber Information Security Law 2015 (86/2015/QH13), Cybersecurity Law 2018 (24/2018/QH14), etc.<sup id=fnref:14><a href=#fn:14 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>14</a></sup> However, Vietnam&rsquo;s legal regulations on personal data are still inadequate, inconsistent, and contradictory. Sanctions for violations are scattered in many legal documents, currently at a deficient level and not deterrent enough.<sup id=fnref:15><a href=#fn:15 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>15</a></sup></p><p>In particular, the Cybersecurity Law 2018 provoked many debates nationally and internationally on personal data privacy and information censorship. The law requires companies like Facebook and Google to store information about Vietnamese users in Vietnam physically. It allows the government to block access to a broad range of content that could be defined as allegedly dangerous to national security. A draft decree to clarify the law’s implementation was still under consideration as of November 2020.</p><p>Following that, a Decree on personal data protection is put forward in the drafting process not finished until its version 2 from February 2021. It is expected to provide a robust set of rules regulating specific rights of data subjects, cross-border transfer of data, and processing of sensitive personal data. Non-compliance may subject stakeholders to a temporary suspension of operation and/or revocation of permission for cross-border data transfer, in addition to monetary fines. The governing scope of the Decree encompasses local and foreign companies (onshore and offshore) involved in processing personal data.</p><p>In 2021, the government further limited internet freedom by launching a national code of conduct for people using social media<sup id=fnref:16><a href=#fn:16 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>16</a></sup> and revising a decree to add a provision that would restrict live streaming.<sup id=fnref:17><a href=#fn:17 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>17</a></sup></p><h4 id=censorship-and-surveillance>Censorship and surveillance</h4><p>Under the authoritarian political system, freedom of assembly, association, expression, press and religion, as well as civil society activism, is tightly restricted and controlled by the party despite legislation recognising civil and political rights in the Constitution.<sup id=fnref:18><a href=#fn:18 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>18</a></sup> Certain contents and topics related to curtailing political opposition, unfavourable to the party, corruption, and human rights issues are censored in various ways. In 2022, Vietnam ranked among the lowest globally at 174 out of 180 countries in the Press Freedom Index.<sup id=fnref:19><a href=#fn:19 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>19</a></sup> The country was also classified by Freedom House as “not free” in terms of the Internet with significant obstacles to access, limited content, and significant violations of user rights.<sup id=fnref:20><a href=#fn:20 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>20</a></sup></p><h3 id=reported-cases-of-internet-censorship>Reported cases of internet censorship</h3><p>Citizens enjoy more freedom in online discussions, and blogging and social media have become alternative sources of information and opinions from official public media. Bloggers, activists, and social media users have written about controversial subjects in Vietnam, such</p><p>as human rights, democracy, religions, political figures, the communist party and the state. However, they became subjects under strict censorship and surveillance by authorities, especially those high-profile with many followers and readers.<sup id=fnref:21><a href=#fn:21 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>21</a></sup></p><p>Multiple websites critical of the government are often inaccessible from Vietnam&rsquo;s locations, namely Dân Luận,<sup id=fnref:22><a href=#fn:22 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>22</a></sup> Luật Khoa,<sup id=fnref:23><a href=#fn:23 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>23</a></sup> The Vietnamese,<sup id=fnref:24><a href=#fn:24 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>24</a></sup> Việt Nam Thời báo,<sup id=fnref:25><a href=#fn:25 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>25</a></sup> Dân Làm Báo.<sup id=fnref:26><a href=#fn:26 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>26</a></sup> Unstable and unpredictable access is also reported for international websites such as Human Rights Watch (HRW), the Vietnamese editions of Radio Free Asia (RFA) and the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC).<sup id=fnref:27><a href=#fn:27 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>27</a></sup></p><p>The government had measures to force global technology firms to comply with government’s requests on censorship, such as Facebook’s local servers being taken offline in 2020.<sup id=fnref:28><a href=#fn:28 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>28</a></sup> According to the ministry of public security, in 2021, they have requested Facebook and Google to arrange 24/7 permanent staff to review content, removing 621 accounts, articles and videos with illegal content, and preventing access to 4,214 web servers that post harmful and toxic information from foreign countries.<sup id=fnref:29><a href=#fn:29 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>29</a></sup> In another report from the Ministry of Information and Communication (MIC), in 2021, MIC required Internet Service Providers to censor 3,000 websites regularly, preventing 2,000 websites and posts. The ministry also requires cross-border service providers (Facebook, Google, Apple) to remove harmful and toxic content; specifically, Facebook has blocked/removed more than 3,377 posts; Google has removed 13,141 videos from YouTube; Tiktok blocked/removed: 1,180 videos.<sup id=fnref:30><a href=#fn:30 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>30</a></sup></p><p>Many journalists and bloggers have been arrested, assaulted and received criminal convictions.<sup id=fnref:31><a href=#fn:31 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>31</a></sup> Notable cases include Pham Thi Doan Trang,<sup id=fnref:32><a href=#fn:32 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>32</a></sup>,<sup id=fnref:33><a href=#fn:33 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>33</a></sup> Nguyen Quoc Duc Vuong,<sup id=fnref:34><a href=#fn:34 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>34</a></sup> Nguyen Ngoc Nhu Quynh<sup id=fnref:35><a href=#fn:35 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>35</a></sup>, Tran Thi Nga,<sup id=fnref:36><a href=#fn:36 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>36</a></sup> among 200 people imprisoned.<sup id=fnref:37><a href=#fn:37 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>37</a></sup></p><h2 id=network-landscape-and-internet-penetration>Network Landscape and Internet Penetration</h2><p>Vietnam’s internet penetration rate stood at 73.2% of the total population in 2022 with 72,1 million internet users. There were 3,4 million internet users increased during 2021-2022. Vietnamese spend on average 6 hours and 38 mins daily on the internet on all devices. 95.8% of users access the internet via mobile phone. In addition, there were 156 million cellular mobile connections in Vietnam at the start of 2022.<sup id=fnref:38><a href=#fn:38 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>38</a></sup></p><p>In terms of fixed broadband internet service providers, three leading companies include VNPT (state-owned enterprise), Viettel (military-owned enterprise) and FPT (private - own enterprise), covering 92% of market share.<sup id=fnref:39><a href=#fn:39 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>39</a></sup> In terms of mobile service, Viettel, Mobiphone and Vinaphone are the three leaders, providing services to 98.1% of the market.<sup id=fnref:40><a href=#fn:40 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>40</a></sup> Data from Ookla of July 2022 showed that median download speed via cellular mobile connection stood at 38.23 Mbps, ranked 47/140 countries while the speed provided by fixed broadband internet connection was 76.16 Mbps, ranked 45/182 countries.<sup id=fnref:41><a href=#fn:41 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>41</a></sup></p><p>In terms of pricing, Vietnam is one of the countries with cheapest Internet rates for both fixed and mobile internet. Average monthly package cost for broadband internet in Vietnam is $10.81, ranked 13 out of 220 countries.<sup id=fnref:42><a href=#fn:42 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>42</a></sup> The average price of 1GB of mobile data in Vietnam is US$0.61, ranked 37 out of 223 countries.<sup id=fnref:43><a href=#fn:43 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>43</a></sup></p><p>Social media is widely used in Vietnam with 76.95 million users. Facebook, Zalo, Tiktok and Instagram are the most popular social media platforms in Vietnam. Vietnam is providing 70.4 million users to Facebook and 63.5 million users to Youtube, 39.91 million users to Titok, proving a highly promising and dynamic market for advertising and e-commerce.<sup id=fnref:44><a href=#fn:44 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>44</a></sup> Vietnam’s digital economy is projected to exceed US$43 billion by 2025 as the country continues to pursue projects in e-government, internet of things, smart cities, financial technology, artificial intelligence etc.<sup id=fnref:45><a href=#fn:45 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>45</a></sup></p><p>Over the last few years, the Vietnamese government has made great efforts in pushing the industry 4.0 agenda forward. The ongoing regulatory focus on digital transformation including e-government has helped the nation navigate the COVID-19 health crisis through its timely and evidence-based response and resulted in a significant rise in online public services.</p><h2 id=findings-of-internet-censorship-in-vietnam>Findings of internet censorship in Vietnam</h2><p>The aim of this study was to understand whether and to what extent censorship events occurred in Vietnam during the testing period from January 1st to June 30th, 2022.</p><p>The raw data in this period from OONI included 301,847 tests. However, we have to filter and remove the ones that are untrusted. Normally tests of blocked sites will return a page with the same title. We counted 1108 blocked websites across 10 different networks of autonomous system number (ASN): of which 3 ASN’s networks belong to Viettel (Viettel CHT company, Viettel Group, Viettel Corporation), a military-owned internet service provider; 3 ASN’s networks of state-owned enterprises (VNPT, MOBIFONE, SaiGon Tourist); 1 foreign joint venture enterprise (Vietnammobile); 1 private-owned enterprise (FPT Telecom); 2 foreign enterprises (Home Credit Vietnam Finance, Softnet). Networks with suspicious signals that blocked users are networks that are heavily regulated by the government. There are 2 suppliers that do not block users who are foreign businesses. However, the number of tests is too small. So, it is impossible to confirm anything and it depends on the user to access which category is restricted by the government. The six main internet and mobile service providers of Vietnam blocked users; these are VNPT, Viettel, FPT, Saigon Tourist, MOBIFONE and Vietnam Mobile.</p><p><img src=/post/2022-state-of-internet-censorship-vietnam/images/image1.png></p><p>Figure: Percentage of no blocking and suspect of blocking by internet providers during the testing period.</p><p>Note that the terms used in this report refer to as follows:</p><ul><li>Blocking: DNS confirmed</li><li>No blocking: OK</li><li>Suspect of blocking: DNS inconsistent or DNS confirmed</li><li>Untrusted: No results on HTTP testing</li></ul><h3 id=censorship-of-websites>Censorship of Websites</h3><p>Websites that are actively censored are broken down into 4 categories including:</p><ul><li>Human rights</li><li>Pornography</li><li>Political criticism</li><li>News Media (mainly foreign sites)</li></ul><p><img src=/post/2022-state-of-internet-censorship-vietnam/images/image2.png></p><p>Figure 1: The highest suspicion-blocked categories in Vietnam</p><p>The percentage of users who can&rsquo;t be accessed with political criticism category is the highest with 34%, followed by foreign news sites with 27.9%.

The objective of this study is to gain a better understanding of internet censorship events in Vietnam through the collection and analysis of network measurements. To this end, OONI software tests were run across the country with the aim of collecting and analysing network measurement data that could help examine whether sites, instant messaging apps, and censorship circumvention tools were blocked. Some of the tests that were also run are designed to examine whether systems (“middle boxes”) that could be responsible for censorship, surveillance, and traffic manipulation were present in the tested networks.</p><p>Overall, the accessibility of 2052 sites were tested with 293,415 test times across 10 different ISPs, and the network measurement data collected between 1st January 2022 and 30th June 2022 was analysed. We found 1108 websites (54%) were inaccessible by three major networks including VNPT, FPT and Viettel.</p><p>The key findings of this study show that Vietnamese ISPs appear to be implementing censorship through DNS and http requests (DNS tampering and IP address blocking into black list) which serve block pages. It&rsquo;s worth noting that Vietnamese ISPs appear to be implementing censorship at their own discretion, since the types of sites blocked vary across ISPs as well as the length of time to block or allow access.</p><p>As part of this study, the highest blocked sites belong to following categories:</p><ul><li>Human rights</li><li>Pornography</li><li>Political criticism</li><li>News Media (News sites are mainly foreign news sites)</li></ul><p>The fact that these categories are not blocked on all networks leads us to believe that the Vietnamese ISPs might have been filtering content under broad government orders to block what is related to curtailing political opposition, unfavourable to the party, corruption, and human rights. On a positive note, WhatsApp, Facebook, Zalo, Line, Instagram, Tiktok and several social networks appeared to be accessible on all tested networks during the testing period.</p><p>However, in the process of data research, there are a few limitations such as the test list has not been updated in the software and some pages have changed their domain addresses or died. So, they cannot be accessed, but the software still identifies them as corrupted or blocking and censorship.</p><h2 id=acknowledgements>Acknowledgements</h2><p>We would like to express our gratitude to the anonymous and brave volunteers in Vietnam who have run and continue to run OONI Probe, thus making this research possible.</p><h2 id=annex-i-glossary>Annex I: Glossary</h2><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Term</strong></th><th>Definition</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>DNS</strong></td><td>DNS stands for “Domain Name System” and it maps domain names to IP addresses. A domain is a name that is commonly attributed to websites (when they’re created), so that they can be more easily accessed and remembered. For example, twitter.com is the domain of the Twitter website. However, computers can’t connect to internet services through domain names, but based on IP addresses: the digital address of each service on the internet. Similarly, in the physical world, you would need the address of a house (rather than the name of the house itself) in order to visit it. The Domain Name System (DNS) is what is responsible for transforming a human- readable domain name (such as ooni.org) into its numerical IP address counterpart (in this case:104.198.14.52), thus allowing your computer to access the intended website.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>HTTP</strong></td><td>The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is the underlying protocol used by the World Wide Web to transfer or exchange data across the internet. The HTTP protocol allows communication between a client and a server. It does so by handling a client’s request to connect to a server, and the server’s response to the client’s request. All websites include an HTTP (or HTTPS) prefix (such as <a href=http://example.com/>http://example.com/</a>) so that your computer (the client) can request and receive the content of a website (hosted on a server). All websites include an HTTP (or HTTPS) prefix (such as <a href=http://example.com/>http://example.com/</a>) so that your computer (the client) can request and receive the content of a website (hosted on a server). The transmission of data over the HTTP protocol is unencrypted.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>ISP</strong></td><td>An Internet Service Provider (ISP) is an organization that provides services for accessing and using the internet. ISPs can be state-owned, commercial, community-owned, non-profit, or otherwise privately owned. Vodafone, AT&amp;T, Airtel, and MTN are examples of ISPs.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Middle boxes</strong></td><td>A middlebox is a computer networking device that transforms, inspects, filters, or otherwise manipulates traffic for purposes other than packet forwarding. Many Internet Service Providers (ISPs) around the world use middleboxes to improve network performance, provide users with faster access to websites, and for a number of other networking purposes. Sometimes though, middleboxes are also used to implement internet censorship and/or surveillance. The OONI Probe app includes two tests designed to measure networks with the aim of identifying the presence of middleboxes.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>TCP</strong></td><td>The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is one of the main protocols on the internet. To connect to a website, your computer needs to establish a TCP connection to the address of that website. TCP works on top of the Internet Protocol (IP), which defines how to address computers on the internet. When speaking to a machine over the TCP protocol you use an IP and port pair, which looks something like this: 10.20.1.1:8080. The main difference between TCP and (another very popular protocol called) UDP is that TCP has the notion of a “connection”, making it a “reliable” transport protocol.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>TLS</strong></td><td>Transport Layer Security (TLS) – also referred to as “SSL” – is a cryptographic protocol that allows you to maintain a secure, encrypted connection between your computer and an internet service. When you connect to a website through TLS, the address of the website will begin with HTTPS (such as <a href=https://www.facebook.com/)>https://www.facebook.com/)</a>, instead of HTTP.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>A comprehensive glossary related to OONI can be accessed here: <a href=https://ooni.org/support/glossary/>https://ooni.org/support/glossary/</a>.</p><h2 id=annex-ii-methodology>Annex II: Methodology</h2><h3 id=data>Data</h3><p>Data computed based on the heuristics for this report can be downloaded here: <a href=https://github.com/Sinar/imap-data>https://github.com/Sinar/imap-data</a> whereas aggregated data can be downloaded from <a href=https://explorer.ooni.org/>OONI Explorer</a>.</p><h3 id=coverage><strong>Coverage</strong></h3><p>The iMAP State of Internet Censorship Country Report covers the findings of network measurement collected through Open Observatory of Network Interference (OONI) <a href=https://ooni.org/install/>OONI Probe App</a> that measures the blocking of websites, instant messaging apps, circumvention tools and network tampering.

OONI takes measures to remove them from the collected measurements, to protect its users from <a href=https://ooni.org/about/risks/>potential risks</a>. However, there may be instances where users’ IP addresses and other potentially personally-identifiable information are unintentionally collected, if such information is included in the HTTP headers or other metadata of measurements. For example, this can occur if the tested websites include tracking technologies or custom content based on a user’s network location.</p><h4 id=network-measurements>Network measurements</h4><p>The types of network measurements that OONI collects depend on the types of tests that are run. Specifications about each OONI test can be viewed through its <a href=https://github.com/ooni/spec>git repository</a>, and details about what collected network measurements entail can be viewed through <a href=https://explorer.ooni.org/world/>OONI Explorer</a> or through <a href=https://api.ooni.io/>OONI’s measurement API</a>.</p><p>In order to derive meaning from the measurements collected, OONI processes the data types mentioned above to answer the following questions:</p><ul><li>Which types of OONI tests were run?</li><li>In which countries were those tests run?</li><li>In which networks were those tests run?</li><li>When were tests run?</li><li>What types of network interference occurred?</li><li>In which countries did network interference occur?</li><li>In which networks did network interference occur?</li><li>When did network interference occur?</li><li>How did network interference occur?</li></ul><p>To answer such questions, OONI’s pipeline is designed to answer such questions by processing network measurements data to enable the following:</p><ul><li>Attributing measurements to a specific country.</li><li>Attributing measurements to a specific network within a country.</li><li>Distinguishing measurements based on the specific tests that were run for their collection.</li><li>Distinguishing between “normal” and “anomalous” measurements (the latter indicating that a form of network tampering is likely present).</li><li>Identifying the type of network interference based on a set of heuristics for DNS tampering, TCP/IP blocking, and HTTP blocking.</li><li>Identifying block pages based on a set of heuristics for HTTP blocking.</li><li>Identifying the presence of “middle boxes” within tested networks.</li></ul><p>According to OONI, false positives may occur within the processed data due to a number of reasons. DNS resolvers (operated by Google or a local ISP) often provide users with IP addresses that are closest to them geographically. While this may appear to be a case of DNS tampering, it is actually done with the intention of providing users with faster access to websites. Similarly, false positives may emerge when tested websites serve different content depending on the country that the user is connecting from, or in the cases when websites return failures even though they are not tampered with.</p><p>Furthermore, measurements indicating HTTP or TCP/IP blocking might actually be due to temporary HTTP or TCP/IP failures, and may not conclusively be a sign of network interference. It is therefore important to test the same sets of websites across time and to cross-correlate data, prior to reaching a conclusion on whether websites are in fact being blocked.</p><p>Since block pages differ from country to country and sometimes even from network to network, it is quite challenging to accurately identify them. OONI uses a series of heuristics to try to guess if the page in question differs from the expected control, but these heuristics can often result in false positives. For this reason OONI only says that there is a confirmed instance of blocking when a block page is detected.</p><p>Upon collection of more network measurements, OONI continues to develop its data analysis heuristics, based on which it attempts to accurately identify censorship events.</p><p>The full list of country-specific test lists containing confirmed blocked websites in Myanmar, Cambodia, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam can be viewed here: <a href=https://github.com/citizenlab/test-lists>https://github.com/citizenlab/test-lists</a>.</p><h4 id=heading></h4><h4 id=confirmed-vs-heuristics>Confirmed vs Heuristics</h4><p>Confirmed OONI measurements were based on blockpages with fingerprints recorded here <a href=https://github.com/ooni/blocking-fingerprints>https://github.com/ooni/blocking-fingerprints</a>.</p><p>Hence, heuristics as below were run on raw measurements on all countries under iMAP to further confirm blockings.</p><p>Firstly, IP addresses with more than 10 domains were identified. Then each of the IP address was checked for the following:</p><p><img src=/post/2022-state-of-internet-censorship-vietnam/images/image26.png></p><p>When blocking is determined, any domain redirected to these IP addresses would be marked as ‘dns.confirmed’.</p><p>Secondly, HTTP titles and bodies were analysed to determine blockpages. This <a href="https://explorer.ooni.org/measurement/20220411T125618Z_webconnectivity_IN_58678_n1_6zLG8ySiJHIq07Un?input=http%3A%2F%2Finfluence.in%2F">example</a> shows that the HTTP returns the text <em>‘The URL has been blocked as per the instructions of the DoT in compliance to the orders of Court of Law’</em>. Any domain redirected to these HTTP titles and bodies would be marked as ‘http.confirmed’.</p><p>As a result, false positives are eliminated and more confirmed blockings were obtained including countries like Cambodia, Vietnam and Philippines which have no confirmed blocking fingerprints on OONI.</p><p>In the case of Hong Kong, the results of the heuristics showed external censorship from outside of the country instead of local censorship. Thus, the local researchers had analysed the OONI measurements manually to identify confirmed blockings. The domains identified were based on the timed-out instances.</p><h2 id=about-imap>About iMAP</h2><p>Internet Monitoring Action Project (iMAP) aims to establish regional and in-country networks that monitor network interference and restrictions to the freedom of expression online in 9 countries: Myanmar, Cambodia, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam. Sinar Project is currently working with national digital rights partners in these 9 countries. The project is done via Open Observatory Network Interference (OONI) detection and reporting systems, involving the maintenance of test lists and measurements.</p><p>More information available at: <a href=http://imap.sinarproject.org>imap.sinarproject.org</a>.
