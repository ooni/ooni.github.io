organization in Thailand that advocates for digital rights and civil
liberties. Founded in December 2008, it grew out of a group of netizens
who had concerns about limited internet freedom during post-coup
governments. Its activities are based on five themes: access to
information, freedom of opinion and expression, privacy, participatory
internet governance, and rights over information resources.</p><p>Thai Netizen Network supported OONI activities by updating the
country-specific test list for Thailand, coordinating censorship
measurement, and conducting <a href=https://ooni.org/post/thailand-internet-censorship/>research
projects</a>
