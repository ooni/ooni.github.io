<a href=https://ooni.io/post/ethiopia-whatsapp-telegram/>blocked</a> access to
WhatsApp and Telegram after the mid-June 2019 internet blackouts. But
after the attempted coup and the most recent internet blackout (which
ended on 27th June 2019), Ethio Telecom appears to have <a href=https://explorer.ooni.io/measurement/20190627T180049Z_AS24757_DRqN0RPWDp9oDHQnwiupts4SVjwMPL0OW9ETxObziN5IJvYcle>blocked access to Facebook</a>,

Recent <a href=https://ooni.io/nettest/telegram/>testing of Telegram</a> from

in Ethiopia (though it remains unclear why Ethio Telecom chose to block
Facebook, instead of Telegram, this time around).</p><p>Similarly to the blocking of WhatsApp, OONI measurements show that
access to Facebook Messenger was <a href=https://explorer.ooni.io/measurement/20190627T180049Z_AS24757_DRqN0RPWDp9oDHQnwiupts4SVjwMPL0OW9ETxObziN5IJvYcle>blocked in Ethiopia by 18:00 UTC on 27th June 2019</a>

strongly suggesting that the app is blocked. Recent OONI measurements
show that access to Facebook Messenger <a href=https://explorer.ooni.io/measurement/20190813T145809Z_AS24757_WGLBzaPYVww4eNA3ltQGIodXwGEXP4cLEQDtj5dgTaVKG7uHyt>remains blocked</a>

that the testing of facebook.com presents anomalies, suggesting that
access to the site is blocked in Ethiopia. Previous measurements leading

but the lack of reliable measurements in the interim until 2nd July 2019
limits our ability to determine whether the blocking of facebook.com
started along with the blocking of Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp on
27th June 2019.</p><h1 id=blocking-of-african-arguments-website>Blocking of African Arguments website</h1><p>Our attention was drawn to the alleged blocking of the <a href=https://africanarguments.org/>African Arguments</a> website in Ethiopia, a

corroborate the reports from Ethiopian internet users.</p><p>OONI’s <a href=https://ooni.io/nettest/web-connectivity/>Web Connectivity test</a> (designed to measure
the TCP/IP, DNS, and HTTP blocking of websites) was run in Ethiopia to
measure the potential blocking of africanarguments.org. The collected

on mobile networks, strongly suggesting that Ethio Telecom blocks
africanarguments.org by means of DNS tampering. However, measurements
collected from WiFi networks show that the site was

After
the political changes of 2018, hundreds of <a href=https://ooni.io/post/ethiopia-unblocking/>websites were unblocked</a>, but the recent

<a href=https://ooni.org/post/ethiopia-whatsapp-telegram/>social media censorship</a>,

point to a dangerous path for freedom of expression, access to
information, and associated human rights in the country. In addition,
the lack of transparency and accountability as to why these websites and
apps are blocked is a cause for concern.</p><p>Network measurement data collected from Ethiopia indicate a pattern: The
lifting of complete internet blackouts is followed by the blocking of
social media and messaging applications, with WhatsApp, Telegram,
Facebook Messenger, and facebook.com being the most affected. We also
observed more censorship on mobile networks than on fixed-line (WiFi)
