<a href=https://ooni.io/post/ethiopia-whatsapp-telegram/>blocked</a> access to
WhatsApp and Telegram after the mid-June 2019 internet blackouts. But
after the attempted coup and the most recent internet blackout (which
ended on 27th June 2019), Ethio Telecom appears to have <a href=https://explorer.ooni.io/measurement/20190627T180049Z_AS24757_DRqN0RPWDp9oDHQnwiupts4SVjwMPL0OW9ETxObziN5IJvYcle>blocked access to Facebook</a>,

in Ethiopia (though it remains unclear why Ethio Telecom chose to block
Facebook, instead of Telegram, this time around).</p><p>Similarly to the blocking of WhatsApp, OONI measurements show that
access to Facebook Messenger was <a href=https://explorer.ooni.io/measurement/20190627T180049Z_AS24757_DRqN0RPWDp9oDHQnwiupts4SVjwMPL0OW9ETxObziN5IJvYcle>blocked in Ethiopia by 18:00 UTC on 27th June 2019</a>

strongly suggesting that the app is blocked. Recent OONI measurements
show that access to Facebook Messenger <a href=https://explorer.ooni.io/measurement/20190813T145809Z_AS24757_WGLBzaPYVww4eNA3ltQGIodXwGEXP4cLEQDtj5dgTaVKG7uHyt>remains blocked</a>

that the testing of facebook.com presents anomalies, suggesting that
access to the site is blocked in Ethiopia. Previous measurements leading

but the lack of reliable measurements in the interim until 2nd July 2019
limits our ability to determine whether the blocking of facebook.com
started along with the blocking of Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp on
27th June 2019.</p><h1 id=blocking-of-african-arguments-website>Blocking of African Arguments website</h1><p>Our attention was drawn to the alleged blocking of the <a href=https://africanarguments.org/>African Arguments</a> website in Ethiopia, a
