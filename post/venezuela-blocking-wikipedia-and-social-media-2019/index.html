<a href=https://vesinfiltro.com/noticias/wikipedia_2019-01/>reported</a> on the
blocking of all language editions of Wikipedia. According to their
report, the Wikipedia blockage took place after some articles on
Wikipedia made reference to opposition leader, Juan Guaidó, as the

started on 12th January 2019 and was lifted by 18th January 2019.</p><p>The temporary blocking of wikipedia.org is corroborated by <a href="https://explorer.ooni.io/measurement/20190113T203747Z_AS8048_zmgCmhj2SnRKM6utWKbrj2GHz9UFtYq5db0nYWIbSJzDsHOXWE?input=https:%2F%2Fwikipedia.org">OONI data</a>,

to the site on the same day. Between 13th to 16th January 2019, we
observe a high amount of HTTP failures, but sporadically see connections
to wikipedia.org succeeding, suggesting that the way that CANTV
implemented censorship was non-deterministic, since it doesn&rsquo;t cover all
of the traffic.</p><p>Anomalous <a href=https://explorer.ooni.io/country/VE>OONI measurements</a>,
involving the testing of wikipedia.org between 13th to 16th January
2019, present HTTP failures and timeout errors. The possibility of
IP-based blocking is ruled out by the fact that OONI Probe tests
successfully connected to the IPs of wikipedia.org, but HTTP(S) requests
resulted in connection timeouts.</p><p>To investigate further, we <a href=https://vesinfiltro.com/noticias/wikipedia_2019-01/>collaborated with Venezuela Inteligente on some manual testing</a>, using
curl. We were able to validate the blocking by fingerprinting the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication>TLS SNI field</a>.</p><p>In the curl request below, we can see that the connection aborted after
the first Client Hello message.</p><pre tabindex=0><code>$ curl -v https://es.wikipedia.org

Hello message includes the SNI field with the hostname of
“wikipedia.org”, the connection is not going to be successful. We
therefore reached the conclusion that CANTV blocked Wikipedia by means
of SNI filtering.</p><p>By using the <a href=https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-tls-esni>Encrypted SNI (ESNI)</a> feature of
<a href=https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2018/10/18/encrypted-sni-comes-to-firefox-nightly/>Firefox Nightly</a>,
we were able to successfully connect to wikipedia.org, further
confirming the hypothesis that filtering occurred at the SNI field. This
highlights the importance of the ESNI feature. If integrated into more
browsers, more users could potentially circumvent some forms of internet
censorship, without having to install circumvention tools.</p><p>It’s worth adding that, through <a href="https://explorer.ooni.io/measurement/20190116T200226Z_AS8048_wqxT1347WsntMSMpRyvzOvkjjLjxBvrGPfnglS6IEVdh4Zn0X5?input=http:%2F%2Fes.wikipedia.org">OONI measurements</a>,
we observe connections to wikipedia.org failing on <em>both</em> HTTP and
HTTPS, as the initial HTTP requests (prior to the 302 redirect to HTTPS)
are also being interfered with, leading to connection timeouts. Since we
notice timeouts on the HTTP (plaintext) request too, it’s likely the
case that CANTV blocked wikipedia.org by means of SNI filtering and HTTP
blocking as well.</p><p>Our hypothesis is that CANTV may have a filtering rule which looks for
the substring “wikipedia.org” and closes the connection on the
server-side. This could explain why we see the blocking affecting both
SNI and host header fields. It may also be the case that CANTV’s
blocking equipment includes host header field <em>and</em> SNI field support.
We are currently unable to test and confirm these hypotheses, since the
blocking of wikipedia.org has been lifted.</p><h1 id=blocking-of-instagram-twitter-and-youtube>Blocking of Instagram, Twitter and YouTube</h1><p>Last Monday, 21st January 2019, Venezuela Inteligente
<a href=https://vesinfiltro.com/noticias/twitter_youtube_instagram_2019-01/>reported</a>
the blocking of YouTube, Instagram and Twitter by CANTV.</p><p>The block was presumably motivated by the circulation of videos showing
members of the Bolivarian National Guard of Venezuela chanting
anti-government slogans and showing solidarity with the opposition.
Venezuela Inteligente reported that the blocks only lasted for a few
hours and ended on the same day, by 9:50 am (GMT-4) local-time.</p><p>To measure the blocks, <a href=https://vesinfiltro.com/>Venezuela Inteligente</a> and <a href=https://ipysvenezuela.org/>IPYS Venezuela</a> coordinated an <a href=https://ooni.io/install/>OONI Probe</a> measurement campaign, sharing <a href=https://run.ooni.io/>OONI Run</a> links with Venezuelans to test YouTube,
Instagram and Twitter across the country. According to Venezuela
Inteligente, this garnered large public response, with about 2,100
clicks on OONI Run links since 21st January 2019.</p><p>The following graph shares <a href=https://explorer.ooni.io/country/VE>OONI data</a>, showing the blocking of

showing that access to youtube.com, twitter.com and instagram.com was
temporarily blocked on 21st January 2019 for about two hours (mainly
between 12pm UTC to 2pm UTC).</p><p>Similarly to the blocking of Wikipedia, the affected sites were blocked
with a combination of SNI filtering and HTTP blocking, as evidenced by
curl measurements and OONI measurements. All anomalous <a href=https://api.ooni.io/files/by_country/VE>OONI measurements</a> present HTTP
failures and timeout errors, consistent with SNI filtering of
youtube.com, instagram.com and twitter.com. The blocking of these sites
also appears to be non-deterministic, since it does not cover 100% of
the traffic and we observe some successful measurements as well.</p><p>While access to these social media sites has since been restored,

in throughput starting from the end of December 2018.</p><p><img src=/post/venezuela-january-2019/ve-mlab.png alt="M-Lab data graph"></p><p><strong>Source:</strong> M-Lab, <a href=https://www.measurementlab.net/data/>https://www.measurementlab.net/data/</a></p><p>It remains unclear though if this decrease in throughput is due to
networks being overloaded or due to throttling.</p><p>Locals reported that internet access was disrupted in several states
between 23rd to 27th January 2019. IPYS Venezuela and Venezuela
Inteligente received reports of connectivity issues in Portuguesa,
Anzoátegui and Táchira on 23rd January 2019, and in parts of Trujillo
and Bolivar on 26th January 2019.</p><p>During this period, offline forms of censorship were reported as well.
According to IPYS Venezuela, the Chilean TV channel, Canal 24 horas, was
<a href=https://ipysvenezuela.org/alerta/balance-especial-ipysve-23-y-24enero-la-censura-y-la-cautela-informativa-marcaron-la-agenda-politica-en-venezuela/>censored on subscription TV services</a>
on 24th January 2019 after it broadcast the signal of the Colombian
channel NTN24 (which has been censored in Venezuela since February
2014). The swearing-in of Juan Guaidó was not televised either.</p><h1 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h1><p>This is the first time we are seeing fast-paced, tactical changes to
censorship by Venezuelan ISPs. CANTV has started to rely on more
advanced censorship techniques since mid 2018, complimenting
<a href=https://ooni.org/post/venezuela-internet-censorship/>DNS-based</a>
censorship. Manual testing conducted in Venezuela (correlated with
<a href=https://api.ooni.io/files/by_country/VE>OONI measurements</a>) shows
that CANTV is implementing SNI-based filtering as well.</p><p>This is not, however, the first time that we are observing internet
censorship in the country. We previously
<a href=https://ooni.org/post/venezuela-internet-censorship/>reported</a>
on pervasive media censorship in Venezuela, as well as on the blocking
of currency exchange websites and political sites.</p><p>The current political crisis has motivated the state ISP, CANTV, to
block social media in a more tactical way, restricting the reach of
specific public speeches that Venezuelans can only see online, on top of
previously
<a href=https://ooni.org/post/venezuela-internet-censorship/>reported</a>
long-standing blocks (and all within the context of highly censored TV
and radio).</p><p>Network measurements collected from Venezuela have shown (and continue
to show) a strong correlation between internet censorship and political
events. The situation remains tense and as political events unfold, the
public can monitor censorship events through the use of <a href=https://ooni.io/install/>OONI Probe</a> and <a href=https://api.ooni.io/>OONI data</a>.</p><p>We thank all OONI Probe users in Venezuela who made this study possible.</p><p>As previously also reported by netblocks:</p><p><a href=https://netblocks.org/reports/wikipedia-blocked-in-venezuela-as-internet-controls-tighten-XaAwR08M>https://netblocks.org/reports/wikipedia-blocked-in-venezuela-as-internet-controls-tighten-XaAwR08M</a></p><p><a href=https://netblocks.org/reports/venezuela-social-media-restricted-amid-caracas-incident-zgBLoXA4>https://netblocks.org/reports/venezuela-social-media-restricted-amid-caracas-incident-zgBLoXA4</a></p><p><a href=https://netblocks.org/reports/major-internet-disruptions-in-venezuela-amid-protests-4JBQ2kyo>https://netblocks.org/reports/major-internet-disruptions-in-venezuela-amid-protests-4JBQ2kyo</a></p><p><a href=https://netblocks.org/reports/venezuela-total-internet-blackouts-qr8VeYy5>https://netblocks.org/reports/venezuela-total-internet-blackouts-qr8VeYy5</a></p><p><a href=https://netblocks.org/reports/venezuela-national-assembly-live-streams-disrupted-4M8JQvy0>https://netblocks.org/reports/venezuela-national-assembly-live-streams-disrupted-4M8JQvy0</a></p></main></div><footer class=p-4><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-12 col-md-4"><div class=pb-2><img src=/images/logos/ooni-horizontal.svg height=32px alt="OONI Logo"></div><div class=pb-4>Global community measuring internet censorship around the world.</div><div><div>© 2022 Open Observatory of Network Interference (OONI)</div><div><a href=https://github.com/ooni/license>Content available under a Creative Commons
