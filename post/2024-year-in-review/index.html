Once we had established the legal entity, we navigated the necessary bureaucratic processes to have OONI upgraded to a foundation. We made the decision to transition from an association to a foundation in order to strengthen OONI&rsquo;s governance structure and enhance its stability as an organization.</p><p>Now, OONI has achieved the highest form of nonprofit status in Italy, ushering in a new era of growth.</p><p>This exciting development follows almost a decade of support from the <a href=https://www.torproject.org/>Tor Project</a>, where OONI was born back in 2011.

Over the past 7 years, OONI Run has been <a href=https://ooni.org/support/ooni-censorship-measurement-campaigns#examples-of-ooni-censorship-measurement-campaigns>used extensively by community members</a> in Venezuela, Malaysia, India, and around the world as part of their censorship measurement campaigns aimed at monitoring and rapidly responding to emergent censorship events. To improve the OONI Run platform and better meet community needs, we previously conducted an <a href=https://ooni.org/post/2020-06-09-ooni-run-usability-study-findings/>OONI Run usability study</a>, through which we documented extensive community feedback.</p><p><a href=https://run.ooni.org/>OONI Run v2</a> is a <strong>major revamp</strong> that addresses key <a href=https://ooni.org/post/2020-06-09-ooni-run-usability-study-findings/>community feedback and needs</a>.</p><p>Specifically, OONI Run v2 includes the following exciting new features:</p><ul><li>Shortened OONI Run links;</li><li>Ability to dynamically update OONI Run links;</li><li>Automated testing of OONI Run links;</li><li>Ability to easily identify, retrieve, and aggregate measurements on <a href=https://explorer.ooni.org/>OONI Explorer</a> from an OONI Run link.</li></ul><p>With the launch of OONI Run v2, we also introduced <a href=https://ooni.org/post/2024-launch-ooni-run-v2/#ui-changes-to-ooni-probe-android>UI improvements to OONI Probe Android</a>.

To enable communities worldwide to run OONI Probe and contribute measurements (which are published as open data on <a href=https://explorer.ooni.org/>OONI Explorer</a> in real-time), we have made OONI Probe available for <a href=https://ooni.org/install/>both mobile and desktop</a> platforms. Specifically, OONI Probe is available for <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.openobservatory.ooniprobe">Android</a>, <a href="https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdid=org.openobservatory.ooniprobe">F-Droid</a>, <a href=https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id1199566366>iOS</a>, <a href=https://ooni.org/install/desktop>Windows</a>, <a href=https://ooni.org/install/desktop>macOS</a>, and <a href=https://ooni.org/install/cli/ubuntu-debian/>Linux</a>.</p><p>While this sounds great, in practice it means that we maintain OONI Probe in 4 different codebases: <a href=https://github.com/ooni/probe-android>OONI Probe Android</a>, <a href=https://github.com/ooni/probe-ios>OONI Probe iOS</a>, <a href=https://github.com/ooni/probe-desktop>OONI Probe Desktop</a>, <a href=https://github.com/ooni/probe-cli>OONI Probe Command Line Interface (CLI)</a>. Given that we aim to have feature parity across OONI Probe apps, we need to implement changes in each of these 4 codebases every time we introduce a new feature. Having to do this each time in 4 different codebases not only reduces the speed at which we can ship new features, but it also increases the risk of introducing bugs. It also means that our software doesn&rsquo;t always have full feature parity across all platforms and even when it does, there are some differences that are hard to get right. In our line of work, where there is often the need to quickly adjust our software in response to emergent censorship events or infrastructure changes, having to implement changes in 4 different codebases is, simply put, a burden.</p><p>To <strong>improve the long-term sustainability of the OONI Probe apps</strong> and to enable us to fix bugs and ship new features faster and more effectively, we worked on creating an <strong><a href=https://github.com/ooni/probe-multiplatform>OONI Probe multiplatform app</a></strong> throughout 2024. This means we now have a unified codebase for OONI Probe Mobile and we will eventually also support the OONI Probe desktop apps through the same codebase. As part of this, we <a href=https://github.com/ooni/probe-multiplatform>rewrote the OONI Probe app</a> using <a href=https://www.jetbrains.com/kotlin-multiplatform/>Kotlin Multiplatform</a> for code sharing, and <a href=https://www.jetbrains.com/compose-multiplatform/>Compose Multiplatform</a> for shared UIs across platforms.</p><p>Notably, we almost reached feature parity on OONI Probe Android and iOS in 2024, and we <strong>launched our first multiplatform app in production</strong>: <a href=https://apps.apple.com/us/app/news-media-scan/id6738992797>News Media Scan on iOS</a>. This is an OONI Probe-based app developed in collaboration with <a href=https://www.dw.com/>Deutsche Welle (DW)</a> to measure the blocking of news media websites. Similarly to OONI Probe, we publish News Media Scan app test results as <a href=https://ooni.org/data/>open data</a> in real-time. We previously launched the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dw.ooniprobe">Android version of the News Media Scan app</a> in October 2023.</p><p>We aim to launch the OONI Probe multiplatform app for mobile and desktop platforms in 2025. Stay tuned!</p><h3 id=presenting-thematic-censorship-findings-on-ooni-explorer>Presenting thematic censorship findings on OONI Explorer</h3><div><a href=/post/2024-year-in-review/images/image6.png><img src=/post/2024-year-in-review/images/image6_hu17026536140219894542.png></a></div><p><strong>Image:</strong> <a href=https://explorer.ooni.org/>OONI Explorer</a>.</p><p>In real-time, we publish OONI measurements collected from around the world as <a href=https://ooni.org/data/>open data</a>. Since 2012, we have published <a href=https://explorer.ooni.org/>more than 2 billion network measurements</a> from 28 thousand networks in 242 countries and territories. Every day, new measurements from around the world are openly published in real-time, shedding light on emergent censorship events. As a result, OONI data is one of the largest open datasets on internet censorship to date.</p><p>To enable human rights defenders (and the public at large) to explore OONI data and discover global censorship events, we have built <a href=https://explorer.ooni.org/>OONI Explorer</a> (originally <a href=https://blog.torproject.org/ooni-explorer-censorship-and-other-network-anomalies-around-world/>launched in 2016</a>, and <a href=https://ooni.org/post/next-generation-ooni-explorer/>revamped</a> in 2019), a web platform that enables users to explore OONI measurements and track global censorship events in real-time. OONI Explorer includes a <a href=https://explorer.ooni.org/search>search tool</a> (which, for example, enables users to discover confirmed blocked websites), a <a href=https://explorer.ooni.org/chart/mat>Measurement Aggregation Toolkit</a> (which enables users to generate charts based on aggregate views of OONI data), and a <a href=https://explorer.ooni.org/findings>Censorship Findings</a> platform (among <a href=https://ooni.org/post/2023-new-explorer-features/>other pages and features</a>).</p><p>However, beyond the <a href=https://explorer.ooni.org/findings>Censorship Findings</a> reports (which are limited to specific cases), OONI Explorer generally requires digging through OONI measurements to discover censorship events. While this may be great for curious researchers, it may be challenging for human rights defenders who are interested in quickly and easily accessing data for rapid response purposes. Moreover, <a href=https://ooni.org/support/interpreting-ooni-data/>interpreting OONI measurements</a> can potentially be challenging for those who are not already familiar with OONI tools and methodologies.</p><p>To enable human rights defenders to more easily discover and respond to censorship events based on OONI data, we worked towards presenting thematic censorship findings on <a href=https://explorer.ooni.org/>OONI Explorer</a> throughout 2024.</p><p>To determine which censorship findings would be most useful for the internet freedom community to present on <a href=https://explorer.ooni.org/>OONI Explorer</a>, we conducted extensive user research, involving both a <a href=https://forms.gle/tYv3pecJiUFfUfEh9>survey</a> and interviews with community members who use OONI Explorer as part of research and advocacy. The goal of this user research was to better understand how the internet freedom community uses OONI Explorer, the challenges they encounter in discovering censorship findings through the platform, and the types of censorship findings that they would find most useful.</p><p>Based on community feedback collected as part of this user research, we:</p><ul><li><strong>Launched an improved navigation menu for OONI Explorer</strong> to enhance the discoverability of resources and to enable the addition of new thematic censorship findings pages;</li><li>Determined that the <strong>new thematic censorship findings pages</strong> on OONI Explorer will focus on the following themes: <a href=https://github.com/ooni/explorer/issues/940>News Media</a>, <a href=https://github.com/ooni/explorer/issues/939>Social Media</a>, and <a href=https://github.com/ooni/explorer/issues/941>Circumvention</a>.</li></ul><p>Community feedback also informed the ways through which information can be presented on each of these thematic pages, as well as which information to prioritize.</p><p>In 2024, we completed the core development work for the new OONI Explorer thematic censorship findings pages and we started internal testing and polishing of the pages in preparation for the upcoming launch. We are aiming to launch the new thematic censorship findings pages in 2025. Stay tuned!</p><h2 id=ooni-methods>OONI methods</h2><h3 id=new-experiments>New experiments</h3><p>In response to the dynamically changing censorship environment, we are improving our measurement methodologies on an ongoing basis.</p><p>Some highlights from 2024 include:</p><ul><li><p><strong>New Encrypted Client Hello (ECH) experiment.</strong> In recent years, OONI data is increasingly <a href=https://ooni.org/reports/>showing</a> that blocks are implemented by means of TLS interference around the world. This is quite unsurprising given that most websites and apps these days are hosted on HTTPS, using the TLS protocol for encryption. However, the initial <a href=https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/ssl/what-happens-in-a-tls-handshake/>“Client Hello” message</a> has a field which transmits in the clear the domain we want to access, enabling passive network observersers to discover which websites users are accessing. <a href=https://blog.cloudflare.com/announcing-encrypted-client-hello/>Encrypted Client Hello (ECH)</a> was introduced to address this problem by encrypting the “Client Hello” message and bolstering online privacy. But in November 2024, <a href=https://theins.ru/news/275980>Russia blocked ECH</a>. In response to this block, and in light of the risk that more countries may start blocking ECH over the next years, we designed a <strong><a href=https://github.com/ooni/spec/blob/master/nettests/ts-039-echcheck.md>new “ECH Check” experiment</a></strong> which measures whether blocking is triggered by the presence of the Encrypted Client Hello (ECH) extension in the Client Hello during a TLS handshake. In late November 2024, we <a href=https://github.com/ooni/probe-cli/releases/tag/v3.24.0>shipped our new ECH Check experiment</a> as part of the OONI Probe apps and we started <a href="https://explorer.ooni.org/search?since=2024-12-27&until=2025-01-27&failure=true&test_name=echcheck">publishing ECH measurements</a> as open data in real-time.</p></li><li><p><strong>New OpenVPN experiment.</strong> As part of their <a href=https://www.opentech.fund/fellows/ain-ghazal/>OTF Information Controls Fellowship</a> with OONI, Ain Ghazal <a href=https://github.com/ooni/probe-cli/pull/1585>contributed</a> a new <a href=https://github.com/ooni/spec/blob/master/nettests/ts-040-openvpn.md>OpenVPN experiment</a> to OONI Probe. In 2024, we shipped this experiment as part of the <a href=https://ooni.org/install/>OONI Probe apps</a> and we started publishing <a href="https://explorer.ooni.org/search?since=2024-12-27&until=2025-01-27&failure=false&test_name=openvpn">OpenVPN measurements as open data</a> in real-time.</p></li><li><p><strong>Throttling methodology.</strong> Over the past few years, we have created a <a href=https://github.com/ooni/probe-cli/blob/master/docs/design/dd-007-throttling.md>methodology for measuring targeted cases of throttling</a>. As part of this methodology, we analyze OONI <a href=https://github.com/ooni/spec/blob/master/nettests/ts-017-web-connectivity.md>Web Connectivity</a> data (which is collected through the <a href=https://ooni.org/install/>OONI Probe</a> testing of URLs) to detect targeted cases of extreme throttling that impact specific online services (such as the throttling of Twitter/X). Specifically, OONI’s methodology for measuring targeted cases of throttling involves the <strong>analysis of timing information during HTTPS requests</strong> in <a href=https://github.com/ooni/spec/blob/master/nettests/ts-017-web-connectivity.md>Web Connectivity</a> data. This methodology has been successful in measuring various cases of throttling, such as those documented as part of our research reports on throttling cases in <a href=https://ooni.org/post/2023-throttling-kz-elections/#throttling-of-sites>Kazakhstan</a>, <a href=https://ooni.org/post/2022-russia-blocks-amid-ru-ua-conflict/#twitter-throttled>Russia</a>, and <a href=https://ooni.org/post/2023-turkey-throttling-blocking-twitter/>Turkey</a>. In 2024, we published a <a href=https://github.com/ooni/probe-cli/blob/master/docs/design/dd-007-throttling.md>design document about our throttling methodology</a> to support related research and future work.</p></li></ul><h3 id=expanding-oonis-testing-model-to-support-richer-testing-input>Expanding OONI’s testing model to support richer testing input</h3><p>With the emergence of new internet protocols (such as DNS-over-TLS (DoT), DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH), and HTTP over QUIC (HTTP/3)) and news forms of internet censorship, there is increasing need to expand OONI’s testing model to more dynamically measure novel forms of internet censorship. We previously developed new experiments for measuring <a href=https://github.com/ooni/spec/blob/master/nettests/ts-028-dnscheck.md>DoT/DoH blocking</a> and HTTP/3 blocking, based on which we wrote papers that were published by <a href=https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3487552.3487836>IMC 2021</a> and <a href=https://www.ndss-symposium.org/wp-content/uploads/dnspriv21-02-paper.pdf>NDSS 2021</a> (to the best of our knowledge, these papers are the first efforts focusing on HTTP/3 and DoT/DoH censorship measurements from countries that include Iran and China).</p><p>However, limitations in our testing model meant that we needed to manually deploy our research client (<a href=https://github.com/ooni/probe-cli/tree/master/internal/cmd/miniooni>miniooni</a>) to run a limited number of measurements with inputs specific to these kinds of tests from a few vantage points, manually download results from S3, and manually write a custom pipeline for scoring the measurements.</p><p>We therefore worked towards expanding OONI’s testing model to support richer testing input and, by extension, enable all OONI Probe app users worldwide to more easily run novel experiments, automatically process these measurements and present findings on <a href=https://explorer.ooni.org/>OONI Explorer</a> as open data. This involved making improvements to the communication layer between the measurement coordination infrastructure and probes to improve our ability to provide a richer set of configuration parameters to network experiments that goes beyond just providing them with URLs to test.</p><p>In 2024, we <a href="https://github.com/ooni/probe-cli/pulls?q=label%3A2024-06-richer-input+is%3Aclosed">completed the bulk of the work related to expanding OONI’s testing model</a> to support richer testing input. As part of this, we <a href=https://github.com/ooni/probe-cli/pull/1615>refactored</a> the OONI Probe engine to improve its internal representation of richer input and to enable each experiment to define its own richer testing input structure. This refactoring change enabled us to reduce the complexity and to read richer testing input from experiment-specific APIs, as well as from OONI Run v2 descriptors.</p><p>Notably, we <a href=https://github.com/ooni/probe-cli/pull/1585>merged</a> the <a href=https://github.com/ooni/spec/blob/master/nettests/ts-040-openvpn.md>OpenVPN experiment</a> (developed by <a href=https://www.opentech.fund/fellows/ain-ghazal/>Ain Ghazal</a> as part of their OTF fellowship with OONI) with full support for using richer testing input. We also published a <a href=https://github.com/ooni/probe-cli/blob/master/docs/design/dd-008-richer-input.md>design document</a> which provides details about our choices for supporting richer testing input, the refactoring of the OONI Probe engine to enable richer testing input, our implementation of richer testing input through the OpenVPN experiment, as well as our implementation of other related improvements. This document also lists next steps for potential future work.</p><h3 id=advancing-ooni-data-analysis>Advancing OONI data analysis</h3><p>Over the past two years, we have been advancing OONI data analysis methods through our <a href=https://docs.ooni.org/data/pipeline/>latest</a> data processing pipeline: <a href=https://github.com/ooni/data>OONI Pipeline v5</a>. Our goal is to automate the detection and characterization of more forms of website censorship.</p><p>With our previous data processing pipelines, we only <a href=https://ooni.org/support/interpreting-ooni-data/#confirmed>automatically confirmed</a> cases of website blocking based on <a href=https://github.com/ooni/blocking-fingerprints>fingerprints</a> added to our database. These fingerprints pertain to block pages and IP addresses associated with implementing censorship. But if ISPs implement blocks using different techniques – which is often the case globally – those cases are annotated as “<a href=https://ooni.org/support/interpreting-ooni-data/#anomalies>anomalies</a>”, indicating that they might involve censorship, but false positives can occur. Determining whether anomalies are symptomatic of true censorship and characterizing the blocks has required manual, time-consuming data analysis that our team would perform in support of our <a href=https://ooni.org/reports/>research reports</a> and community requests. With the latest <a href=https://github.com/ooni/data>OONI Pipeline v5</a>, we are automating our data analysis efforts!</p><p>More specifically, we are moving beyond the concept of “anomalies” to instead characterize tested services as “blocked”, “down”, or “OK”. The pipeline specifies the blocking details, fully <a href=https://docs.ooni.org/data/pipeline-design/#experimentresult-generation>characterising a block based on all the methods</a> through which it is implemented.</p><p>Even though we have not started using the <a href=https://github.com/ooni/data>OONI Pipeline v5</a> for production API endpoints yet, it has been running for about a year and has been an essential tool to optimize the workflows of our research.</p><p>Specifically, the data analysis capabilities of the new OONI Pipeline v5 supported all of our latest research reports, such as those on <a href=https://ooni.org/post/2024-kazakhstan-report/>internet censorship in Kazakhstan</a>, <a href=https://ooni.org/post/2024-russia-report/>Russia</a>, <a href=https://ooni.org/post/2024-tanzania-lgbtiq-censorship-and-other-targeted-blocks/>Tanzania</a>, <a href=https://ooni.org/post/2023-jordan-blocks-grindr/>Jordan</a>, <a href=https://ooni.org/post/2023-senegal-social-media-blocks/>Senegal</a>, <a href=https://ooni.org/post/2023-brazil-telegram/>Brazil</a>, and <a href=https://ooni.org/post/2023-azerbaijan-internet-censorship/>Azerbaijan</a>. The OONI Pipeline v5 also enabled us to analyze TLS handshakes and apply our <a href=https://github.com/ooni/probe-cli/blob/master/docs/design/dd-007-throttling.md>throttling methodology</a> to investigate targeted cases of throttling in <a href=https://ooni.org/post/2023-throttling-kz-elections/>Kazakhstan</a>, <a href=https://ooni.org/post/2022-russia-blocks-amid-ru-ua-conflict/#twitter-throttled>Russia</a>, and <a href=https://ooni.org/post/2023-turkey-throttling-blocking-twitter/>Turkey</a>. Moreover, the data analysis capabilities of the new pipeline have supported our rapid response efforts, such as when we <a href=https://x.com/OpenObservatory/status/1835360393906074078>immediately responded to the blocking of Telegram in El Salvador</a> by sharing a detailed chart on the reachability of Telegram IPs by probe ASN and target (generated by the OONI Pipeline v5). As anyone can <a href=https://docs.ooni.org/data/pipeline/#setup>run the OONI Pipeline v5</a>, third party researchers have already made use of its data analysis capabilities. Sinar Project, for example, used the OONI Pipeline v5 in support of their <a href=https://imap.sinarproject.org/reports/2024>2024 iMAP research reports on internet censorship in 9 Asian countries</a>.</p><p>We hope to start using the OONI Pipeline v5 for production API endpoints in 2025!</p><h2 id=research>Research</h2><h3 id=research-reports>Research reports</h3><p>In 2024, we published the following research based on the analysis of OONI data:</p><ul><li><a href=https://ooni.org/post/2024-russia-report/>Censorship Chronicles: The systematic suppression of independent media in Russia</a> <a href=https://ooni.org/post/2024-russia-report/>(also published in</a> <a href=https://ooni.org/ru/post/2024-russia-report/>Russian</a>)</li><li><a href=https://ooni.org/post/2024-russia-blocked-ooni-explorer/>Russia blocked OONI Explorer, a large open dataset on Internet censorship</a></li><li><a href=https://ooni.org/post/2024-kazakhstan-report/>Kazakhstan: TLS MITM attacks and blocking of news media, human rights, and circumvention tool sites</a> <a href=https://ooni.org/post/2024-russia-report/>(also published in</a> <a href=https://ooni.org/kk/post/2024-kazakhstan-report/>Kazakh</a> and <a href=https://ooni.org/ru/post/2024-kazakhstan-report/>Russian</a>)</li><li><a href=https://ooni.org/post/2024-tanzania-lgbtiq-censorship-and-other-targeted-blocks/>Tanzania: Surge in online LGBTIQ censorship and other targeted blocks</a> <a href=https://ooni.org/post/2024-russia-report/>(also published in</a> <a href=https://ooni.org/sw/post/2024-tanzania-lgbtiq-censorship-and-other-targeted-blocks/>Swahili</a>)</li><li><a href=https://petsymposium.org/foci/2024/foci-2024-0001.pdf>Internet Sanctions on Russian Media: Actions and Effects</a> (FOCI paper)</li></ul><p>In collaboration with our partner <a href=https://rks.global/>RKS Global</a>, we published a <a href=https://ooni.org/post/2024-russia-report/>new research report</a> documenting the <strong>systematic suppression of independent news media in Russia</strong>.

Our goal is to automate the detection and characterization of more forms of website censorship, and we made important progress throughout 2024. In practice, this tool supported many of our <a href=https://ooni.org/reports/>research reports</a> and rapid response efforts, and we trained third-party researchers on how to use it for their own research. We aim to ship the OONI Pipeline v5 into production in 2025!</li><li><strong>New Social Media Censorship Alert System.</strong> We have been working on building a <a href=https://github.com/ooni/backend/pull/651>Social Media Censorship Alert System</a> with real-time notifications and summaries of blocking alerts based on OONI data. We are <a href=https://github.com/ooni/data/issues/114>improving the alert system</a> and we aim to feed the Social Media Censorship Alert System with the advanced data analysis capabilities of the <a href=https://github.com/ooni/data>OONI Pipeline v5</a> (which automates the detection and characterization of website blocks) to reduce the risk of false positives and false alerts. Our goal is to ship the Social Media Censorship Alert System into production in 2025.</li><li><strong>New OONI Probe multiplatform app.</strong> To improve the long-term sustainability of the <a href=https://ooni.org/install/>OONI Probe apps</a> and to enable us to fix bugs and ship new features faster and more effectively, we worked on creating an <strong><a href=https://github.com/ooni/probe-multiplatform>OONI Probe multiplatform app</a></strong> throughout 2024. We aim to launch the OONI Probe multiplatform app for mobile and desktop platforms in 2025!</li><li><strong>Creating an anonymous credential system for use in OONI Probe.</strong> To increase the trustworthiness of OONI data and protect the <a href=https://ooni.org/data/>OONI dataset</a> from the intentional or unintentional submission of faulty measurements, we will be designing and implementing an anonymous credential system throughout 2025 in collaboration with <a href=https://tumbolandia.net/>Michele Orrù</a>, a cryptographer and expert in digital signatures and zero-knowledge proofs.</li><li><strong>Research reports on internet censorship around the world.</strong> We aim to publish many more <a href=https://ooni.org/reports/>research reports</a> in collaboration with our <a href=https://ooni.org/partners>partners</a>. We also aim to publish timely reports on emergent censorship events on the OONI <a href=https://explorer.ooni.org/findings>Censorship Findings</a> page.</li><li><strong>Strengthening partnerships and support towards the global OONI community.</strong> To expand and diversify global OONI censorship measurement coverage, we aim to expand and strengthen our <a href=https://ooni.org/partners>partnerships</a>. We also aim to improve our community resources and facilitate OONI workshops to help expand the use of <a href=https://ooni.org/data/>OONI data</a> by the internet freedom community.</li></ul><p>Our above priorities for 2025 have been informed by community feedback collected over the years (as well as in response to the dynamic censorship environment worldwide).
