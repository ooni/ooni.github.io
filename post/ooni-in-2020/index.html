Probe is officially supported on Windows.</strong></p><p>Windows is not only the <a href=https://gs.statcounter.com/os-market-share>most widely used desktop operating system</a> in the world, but
it is also commonly used by human rights defenders around the world.
Supporting OONI Probe on Windows has therefore been a popular
<a href=https://ooni.org/post/ooni-partner-gathering-2017/#challenges-and-needs>community request</a>
over the last years, and we are thrilled that this has now been
achieved!</p><p>With the new <a href=https://ooni.org/install/desktop>OONI Probe desktop app</a>, you can run all of the same
<a href=https://ooni.org/nettest/>tests</a> included in the <a href=https://ooni.org/install/mobile>OONI Probe mobile app</a>. As soon as you run tests, you
will immediately have access to the results &ndash; and relevant network
measurement data that can potentially serve as <em>evidence</em> of internet
censorship &ndash; in your app.</p><p>Thanks to the <a href=https://www.localizationlab.org/>Localization Lab</a>

<a href=https://github.com/measurement-kit/measurement-kit>Measurement Kit</a>
library. Now, both the OONI Probe
<a href=https://ooni.org/install/mobile>mobile</a> and
<a href=https://ooni.org/install/desktop>desktop</a> apps are powered entirely
by our new <a href=https://github.com/ooni/probe-engine>Go engine</a> (and we
<a href=https://github.com/ooni/probe-engine/tree/master/experiment>re-wrote</a>
all of the OONI Probe tests in Go).</p><p><strong>This is an important milestone because it means that we can write (and
integrate) new network measurement tests faster and with greater
confidence in code quality, enhancing our ability to more rapidly
respond to emergent censorship events around the world.</strong></p><p>Our new <a href=https://github.com/ooni/probe-engine>Go engine</a> is also
easier for us to maintain (since it enables us to share more code
between the engine and the mobile apps), it’s easier for community
members to review and contribute to our codebase (and they have already
contributed many new tests!), improving the overall robustness and
sustainability of our apps and experiments.</p><h2 id=ooni-run-usability-study>OONI Run usability study</h2><div><a href=/post/ooni-in-2020/images/run.png><img src=/post/ooni-in-2020/images/run_hu79da4636742b60d8987a3a366f6309b1_41372_1000x800_fit_box_2.png srcset="/post/ooni-in-2020/images/run_hu79da4636742b60d8987a3a366f6309b1_41372_2000x1600_fit_box_2.png 2x" title="OONI Run" alt="OONI Run"></a></div><p>To support decentralized censorship measurement efforts and promote
rapid response to emergent censorship events, we carried out a
<a href=https://ooni.org/post/2020-06-09-ooni-run-usability-study-findings/>usability study</a>
to improve <a href=https://run.ooni.io/>OONI Run</a>.</p><p>OONI Run is a platform that you can use to <a href=https://ooni.org/post/ooni-run/>generate mobile deep links
and widget code to coordinate OONI Probe testing</a>. This is especially used by
community members worldwide to coordinate the testing of specific
websites during political events (such as elections and protests), when
censorship events tend to emerge.</p><p>To enable community members to more effectively use <a href=https://run.ooni.io/>OONI Run</a>, we researched its limitations and collected
structured community feedback through a usability study, which involved
a <a href=https://ooni.org/post/2020-ooni-run-survey-and-interviews/>survey and in-depth interviews</a>.</p><p>We documented all of the OONI Run usability study findings in a
<a href=https://ooni.org/post/2020-06-09-ooni-run-usability-study-findings/>report</a>,
and plan to release an improved version of OONI Run in 2021!</p><h1 id=measurement-methodologies>Measurement methodologies</h1><h2 id=new-circumvention-tool-tests>New circumvention tool tests</h2><div><a href=/post/ooni-in-2020/images/tor-test.png><img src=/post/ooni-in-2020/images/tor-test_hufe7b2c3b0d1cc6a849d5e09bc3371cd5_124830_1000x800_fit_box_2.png srcset="/post/ooni-in-2020/images/tor-test_hufe7b2c3b0d1cc6a849d5e09bc3371cd5_124830_2000x1600_fit_box_2.png 2x" title="OONI Probe Tor result" alt="OONI Probe Tor result"></a></div><p>When censorship events emerge, circumvention tools <a href=https://ooni.org/reports/>often get blocked</a> in many countries (likely as part
of attempts to limit censorship circumvention).</p><p>We therefore developed and released <a href=https://ooni.org/post/2020-ooni-probe-desktop-app/#new-circumvention-tool-tests>new circumvention tool tests</a>
to enable the OONI community to check the reachability of specific
circumvention tools: <a href=https://www.torproject.org/>Tor</a> and
<a href=https://psiphon.ca/>Psiphon</a>. We chose these tools because they’re
open source, commonly used by human rights defenders in censored
environments, and we were able to collaborate directly with the
developers of these tools. We had also <a href=https://github.com/ooni/spec/tree/master/nettests>previously developed</a> Tor and
Psiphon tests, and so these new tests build and expand upon our
<a href=https://ooni.org/nettest/>previous methodologies</a>.</p><p>Through the OONI Probe <a href=https://ooni.org/install/mobile>mobile</a> and
<a href=https://ooni.org/install/desktop>desktop</a> apps, you can now run the
following new tests:</p><ul><li><p><strong><a href=https://ooni.org/nettest/tor/>Tor test</a>.</strong> Checks whether
<a href=https://www.torproject.org/>Tor</a> works by measuring the
reachability of a set of services (Tor directory authorities, OR
port, OR port of directory authorities, and obfs4) and by
evaluating whether they can be used in the tested network.</p></li><li><p><strong><a href=https://ooni.org/nettest/psiphon/>Psiphon test</a>.</strong> Checks
whether the <a href=https://psiphon.ca/>Psiphon app</a> works by
attempting to bootstrap, create, and use a Psiphon tunnel to fetch
a webpage from the internet.</p></li></ul><p>As soon as you run these tests, you will immediately have access to the
results in your OONI Probe app (along with the relevant network
measurement data), and (unless if you have opted-out) these test results
will be <a href=https://ooni.org/data/>openly published in real-time</a>. You
can therefore refer to OONI data to track whether
<a href="https://explorer.ooni.org/search?until=2020-12-20&since=2020-11-19&test_name=tor">Tor</a>
and
<a href="https://explorer.ooni.org/search?until=2020-12-20&since=2020-11-19&test_name=psiphon">Psiphon</a>
work around the world.</p><h2 id=new-experiments>New experiments</h2><p>Censorship measurement is like a cat and mouse game.</p><p>As internet censorship becomes more sophisticated, the need to improve
and expand upon our censorship measurement capabilities increases. We
therefore work continuously on improving our censorship measurement
methodologies, and the types of tests that we prioritize on developing
are informed by emerging censorship trends and community needs.</p><p>Throughout 2020, we developed the following new experiments:</p><ul><li><p><a href=https://github.com/ooni/probe-engine/tree/master/experiment/sniblocking>SNI blocking experiment</a></p></li><li><p><a href=https://github.com/ooni/probe-engine/tree/master/experiment/stunreachability>STUN reachability test</a></p></li><li><p>DNS over TLS (DoT) experiment (included in <a href=https://github.com/ooni/probe-engine/tree/master/experiment/dnscheck>DNS check</a>)</p></li><li><p>DNS over HTTPS (DoH) experiment (included in <a href=https://github.com/ooni/probe-engine/tree/master/experiment/dnscheck>DNS check</a>)</p></li><li><p><a href=https://github.com/ooni/probe-engine/tree/master/experiment/urlgetter>URL getter</a> (research tool)</p></li></ul><p>We are grateful to community members who volunteered to run these
experiments in censored environments, enabling us to check whether these
tests work as expected and to improve upon them.</p><p>We are also <em>thrilled</em> that community members contributed <em>many</em> new
network measurement tests for OONI Probe! Now that the OONI Probe apps
are powered by our new <a href=https://github.com/ooni/probe-engine/>Go engine</a>, integrating new tests
has become much easier (in comparison to the C++ <a href=https://github.com/measurement-kit/measurement-kit>Measurement Kit</a> library that
OONI Probe previously relied on).</p><p>New tests contributed by community members include:</p><ul><li><p><a href=https://github.com/ooni/probe-engine/tree/master/experiment/riseupvpn>RiseupVPN blocking test</a></p></li><li><p><a href=https://github.com/ooni/probe-engine/tree/master/experiment/dnscheck>DNS check</a></p></li><li><p><a href=https://github.com/ooni/probe-engine/tree/master/experiment/httphostheader>HTTP host header experiment</a></p></li><li><p><a href=https://github.com/ooni/probe-engine/commit/bfde9a5205d4b384f1b5cfc57aeb8abe04de7946#diff-8ffe2f06c79d27fecf43a54ee25af248f9b82b14941b322997c85d4a51a0b818>HTTP/3 experiment</a></p></li><li><p><a href=https://github.com/ooni/probe-engine/commit/bfde9a5205d4b384f1b5cfc57aeb8abe04de7946#diff-8ffe2f06c79d27fecf43a54ee25af248f9b82b14941b322997c85d4a51a0b818>QUIC experiment</a></p></li></ul><p>We are extremely grateful for these contributions, and we aim to ship

<a href=https://ooni.org/reports/>problem</a>, often affecting marginalized
communities the most.</p><p>To improve the monitoring of website censorship around the world, we aim
to create a <strong>smart URL list system</strong> which will help ensure “smarter”
testing of websites. More specifically, we will prioritize the testing
of websites that are of public interest, whose blocking would have a
greater impact on human rights, and which are frequently blocked (such
as social media services). To help ensure the safety of the tested URLs,
we will continue to run them through the usual <a href=https://github.com/citizenlab/test-lists>Citizen Lab URL review process on GitHub</a>.</p><p>“Smarter” URL testing will enable us – and the broader internet freedom
community – to more effectively <a href=https://ooni.org/data/>monitor</a>,
analyze, and respond to cases of website censorship around the world.</p><p>Throughout 2020, we worked on <strong>building OONI’s smart URL list system</strong>.
We started off by creating a <a href=https://ooni.org/post/ooni-smart-url-list-system/>policy for URL prioritization</a>.
The goal of this
<a href=https://ooni.org/post/policy-url-prioritization/ooni-policy-url-prioritization.pdf>policy</a>
is to determine the criteria based on which the OONI Probe testing of
certain types of URLs will be prioritized over others. Through URL
prioritization, we aim to optimize the value of collected measurements,
ensure regular testing of the same URLs for consistency, ensure that the
tested URLs are relevant to OONI Probe users, and to improve the
monitoring of website censorship globally.</p><p>We added <a href=https://github.com/ooni/api/pull/192>backend support</a> for
URL prioritization based on the <a href=https://github.com/citizenlab/test-lists/blob/master/lists/00-LEGEND-new_category_codes.csv>Citizen Lab test list categories</a>,
as well as for the testing of specific URLs (included in the <a href=https://github.com/citizenlab/test-lists/tree/master/lists>Citizen Lab test lists</a>). To
help increase testing coverage, we <a href=https://github.com/ooni/probe/issues/1208>added support</a> to the <a href=https://ooni.org/install/mobile>OONI Probe mobile app</a> for configuring push
notifications to solicit testing, and so that OONI Probe mobile app
users can receive push notifications and run experiments. This will be
particularly useful during emergent censorship events when fast
coordination of targeted URL testing is crucial.</p><p>To ensure that the measurements are more actionable, we developed <a href=https://github.com/ooni/backend/issues/402>data analysis capabilities</a>
aimed at examining results from a website-centric perspective. To
present measurements, we
<a href=https://github.com/ooni/explorer/pull/475>created</a> an <a href=https://explorer.ooni.org/experimental/website>initial version of a frontend</a>
to present results on <a href=https://explorer.ooni.org/>OONI Explorer</a> in a
website-centric way, and we made progress on creating relevant <a href=https://github.com/ooni/explorer/issues/388>user accounts</a>.</p><p>We have completed most work towards building a smart URL list system and
we aim to release it in 2021!</p><h1 id=real-time-analysis-and-publication-of-global-measurements>Real-time analysis and publication of global measurements</h1><div><a href=/post/ooni-in-2020/images/explorer.png><img src=/post/ooni-in-2020/images/explorer_hud5bcf011d4fbf19d06268ae3754604f5_521921_1000x800_fit_box_2.png srcset="/post/ooni-in-2020/images/explorer_hud5bcf011d4fbf19d06268ae3754604f5_521921_2000x1600_fit_box_2.png 2x" title="OONI Explorer" alt="OONI Explorer"></a></div><p>Starting from November 2019, we are analyzing and <a href=https://ooni.org/data/>openly publishing OONI measurements</a> collected from around the

migrating to new servers and including better monitoring and alerting.</p><p>All of our <a href=https://github.com/ooni/backend>backend work</a> not only
ensured the robustness of <a href=https://github.com/ooni/pipeline>real-time analysis</a> and publication of OONI
measurements, but it also <em>significantly boosted the performance</em> of

inspiring human rights defenders from across Africa, learn from them,
and engage them with censorship measurement methodologies. Our goal was
to train human rights defenders to use measurement tools and datasets as
part of their research and advocacy efforts.</p><p>More specifically, we created video webinars and led the trainings for
the following 2 modules:</p><ul><li><p>Introduction to Network Measurement</p></li><li><p>Detecting Blocking of Websites and Applications (<a href=https://ooni.org/>OONI</a>)</p></li></ul><p>We also helped facilitate the following modules:</p><ul><li><p>Detecting Internet Blackouts (<a href=https://ioda.caida.org/>IODA</a>)</p></li><li><p>Measuring Internet Performance (<a href=https://www.measurementlab.net/>M-Lab</a>)</p></li><li><p>Contextualizing Your Data: Using Local Insight and Qualitative Research</p></li><li><p>Using Measurements in Advocacy (<a href=https://www.accessnow.org/>Access Now</a>)</p></li></ul><p>Throughout the training program, we provided mentorship, created and

with <strong>36 organizations</strong> from around the world on the study of internet
censorship.</p><p>We published an <strong><a href=https://ooni.org/partners>OONI Partners page</a></strong> on
our website to feature these organizations, highlight their important
work, and share the research projects we have collaborated on.</p><p>Throughout 2020, we formed several new partnerships, and we continued to
support our partners primarily through the coordination of censorship
measurement efforts, reviewing and updating <a href=https://github.com/citizenlab/test-lists>test lists</a>, and by providing OONI
data analysis support.</p><h2 id=ooni-workshops-and-presentations>OONI workshops and presentations</h2><p>In light of the <a href=https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019>COVID-19 pandemic</a>,
most conferences were hosted online this year (or cancelled). Online
events though provided a great opportunity to meet and form
collaborations with people who we may have not otherwise met in person
(because they previously did not have the opportunity to travel to
attend such events).</p><p>Throughout 2020, we presented OONI at the following conferences and
events:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Internet Governance Forum (IGF) 2020.</strong> We hosted an <a href=https://www.intgovforum.org/multilingual/content/igf-2020-village-booth-60-open-observatory-of-network-interference-ooni>OONI e-booth</a>
to engage policy researchers and advocates with OONI’s censorship
measurement tools and dataset, address questions, and receive
community feedback (through live consultations). We briefly

how human rights defenders can make use of OONI data during the <a href=https://guardianproject.info/>Guardian Project</a>’s podcast.</p></li></ul><p>On 15th December 2020, we attended Internews’
<a href=https://www.eventbrite.com/e/building-capacity-for-internet-shutdown-advocacy-workshop-report-launch-tickets-130455334417>workshop</a>,
“<em>Building capacity for internet shutdown advocacy: Community needs
assessment</em>”, where we facilitated the discussion on community needs
around censorship measurement data. This workshop builds upon Internews’
<a href=https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5a9efdd2f2e6b149480187ea/t/5fbd37cda282d931e4d38c91/1606236110691/Optima+-+Needs+Assessment+Report+2020.pdf>study</a>
which found that the vast majority of advocates reported that (out of
several network measurement tools) they are most familiar with (and have
experience using) <a href=https://ooni.org/install/>OONI Probe</a>. The
community feedback collected through this workshop will help inform the
development and improvement of our work.</p><h1 id=ooni-verse>OONI-verse</h1><p>In 2020, the OONI community continued to contribute <a href=https://explorer.ooni.org/>many measurements from most countries and territories</a> around

2021 to improve the monitoring of website censorship around the
world.</p></li><li><p><strong>Website-centric stats on OONI Explorer.</strong> Along with improved
website testing (enabled through our smart URL list system), we
aim to display website-centric views on <a href=https://explorer.ooni.org/>OONI Explorer</a> to enable more in-depth
analysis of website censorship globally. We will also create user
accounts for access to more advanced website analysis metrics.</p></li><li><p><strong>Improved OONI Probe Tor test.</strong> We aim to expand upon the <a href=https://ooni.org/nettest/tor/>OONI Probe Tor test</a> to also test Meek,
bootstrap tor, and potentially test other pluggable transports as
well.</p></li><li><p><strong>New network measurement tests.</strong> We aim to ship the new
experiments developed in 2020 as part of the OONI Probe apps, and
develop new tests!</p></li><li><p><strong>New OONI Run platform.</strong> Based on the community feedback that we collected as part of our <a href=https://ooni.org/post/2020-06-09-ooni-run-usability-study-findings/>OONI Run usability
study</a> in 2020, we aim to release a new and improved version of <a href=https://run.ooni.io/>OONI Run</a> in 2021!</p></li><li><p><strong>New Linux packages for OONI Probe.</strong> Throughout 2020, we worked on <a href=https://github.com/ooni/probe-cli/pull/162>building a Debian package</a> for OONI
Probe. In 2021, we will release official Linux packages for OONI
Probe! This will serve as a replacement for the <a href=https://github.com/ooni/probe-legacy>legacy version of ooniprobe</a> (which is
still run by many Linux users around the world). We also aim to
improve the usability of the <a href=https://github.com/ooni/probe-cli>OONI Probe Command Line Interface (CLI)</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Automated OONI Probe testing.</strong> In 2020, we <a href=https://github.com/ooni/probe/issues/916>worked</a> towards
adding support to the <a href=https://ooni.org/install/mobile>OONI Probe mobile app</a> for regular automated
testing. In 2021, we aim to support regular automated testing on
<em>both</em> the OONI Probe <a href=https://ooni.org/install/mobile>mobile</a>
and <a href=https://ooni.org/install/desktop>desktop</a> apps to expand
the stable measurement coverage worldwide.</p></li><li><p><strong>Browser-based censorship measurement tool.</strong> To simplify the
process of running tests during urgent censorship events, we will
experiment with implementing a browser-based network measurement
tool. This will complement the <a href=https://ooni.org/install/>OONI Probe apps</a> and serve needs related to rapid
response.</p></li><li><p><strong>New web platform for community contributions to test lists.</strong> To
enable community contributions to the <a href=https://github.com/citizenlab/test-lists>Citizen Lab’s test lists</a>, we will create
a web-based platform that enables community members to easily
review and contribute to test lists (without having to use GitHub).</p></li><li><p><strong>New community resources.</strong> We aim to publish user guides for
<a href=https://ooni.org/install/>OONI tools</a>, as well as
documentation on how to coordinate censorship measurement
campaigns, how to contribute new nettests, and how to interpret
<a href=https://ooni.org/data/>OONI data</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>More research reports, workshops, and training.</strong> We will continue
to collaborate with community members on investigating censorship
events worldwide and documenting them through the publication of
<a href=https://ooni.org/reports/>research reports</a>. We will also
continue to engage communities through OONI workshops and
training.</p></li></ul><p>Our above priorities for 2021 have been informed by community feedback
collected over the years (as well as in response to the dynamic
censorship environment worldwide). If there are additional areas that
you think we should prioritize, please don’t hesitate to <a href=https://ooni.org/about/#contact>let us know</a>.</p><p>Warm thanks to the global OONI community for supporting our work
throughout 2020!</p><p>We’re grateful to every <a href=https://ooni.org/install/>OONI Probe</a> user
out there, and we’re excited for 2021. Stay tuned!
