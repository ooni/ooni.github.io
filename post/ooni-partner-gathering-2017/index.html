to collaborate with various digital rights organizations in Latin
America, Africa, the Middle East, and Asia. We joined forces to
collaborate on the study of internet censorship by collecting <a href=https://explorer.ooni.org/world/>network measurements</a> from local
vantage points, reviewing and creating <a href=https://github.com/citizenlab/test-lists/tree/master/lists>censorship measurement resources</a>,
and by publishing findings through <a href=https://ooni.org/post/>research reports</a>.</p><p>To strengthen these (and future) partnerships, OONI hosted its first
Partner Gathering thanks to support from the <a href=https://www.opentech.fund/>Open Technology Fund (OTF)</a>, the <a href=https://www.fordfoundation.org/>Ford Foundation</a>, and the <a href=http://mediademocracyfund.org/>Media Democracy Fund (MDF)</a>.</p><p>This two day event was hosted at the University of Toronto on 10th and
11th July 2017. The 22 participants included the OONI team and our
partners from 10 different countries across Africa, Asia, Latin America,
and the Middle East. Our Toronto friends from
<a href=https://psiphon.ca/>Psiphon</a> and <a href=https://citizenlab.ca/>The Citizen Lab</a> joined us as well. Participants came from
a diverse set of backgrounds, including lawyers, policy researchers,
human rights advocates, and software engineers.</p><p>The OONI Partner Gathering brought our international partners together
to share skills, knowledge, and research findings on the study of
internet censorship. The event also provided us the opportunity to
reflect on our collaboration over the last year, and to develop
strategic goals and priorities for the next year(s).</p><p>Since many of the participants also attended the <a href=https://citizenlab.ca/summerinstitute/2017.html>Citizen Lab Summer Institute (CLSI)</a>
during the following days (12th-14th July), we were able to extend our
discussions as part of both events.</p><h1 id=objectives>Objectives</h1><p>The objectives of the OONI Partner Gathering include:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Strengthening our partnerships.</strong> To strengthen our collaboration
moving forward, we aimed to gain a better understanding of partner
needs and to collect feedback that can help inform the development
of our tools and methodologies. The event also aimed to foster
more collaboration amongst OONI partners from around the world.</p></li><li><p><strong>Empowering censorship research participation.</strong> To engage more
communities in censorship research around the world, we aimed to
share skills, knowledge, and methodologies, and to discuss best
practices moving forward.</p></li><li><p><strong>Strategic planning.</strong> By gaining a better understanding of partner
needs and challenges, we aimed to brainstorm on solutions, goals
and priorities on the study of internet censorship.</p></li></ul><h1 id=sessions>Sessions</h1><p>The OONI Partner Gathering consisted of a variety of sessions that aimed
to be as interactive as possible to encourage participation. Session
topics were drawn from both pre-event participant engagement (i.e.
suggestions made by participants prior to the event), and requests and
suggestions made at the event.</p><p>The event’s agenda and all session notes can be found
<a href=https://github.com/OpenObservatory/gatherings/tree/master/partner-gatherings/2017-07-toronto>here</a>.</p><p>Throughout the two-day event, we (the OONI team and many partners)
facilitated the following sessions.</p><h2 id=day-1---10th-july-2017>Day 1 - 10th July 2017</h2><p><strong>1. Information Controls Around the World</strong></p><p>This session consisted of the following stations:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Africa:</strong> Discussing Case Studies and Challenges</p></li><li><p><strong>Asia:</strong> Discussing Case Studies and Challenges</p></li><li><p><strong>Latin America:</strong> Discussing Case Studies and Challenges</p></li></ul><p>Participants were requested to visit each station (for 15 minutes each)
to map information controls and to discuss specific case studies and
challenges within countries of each region.</p><p>The goal of this session was to provide participants with a broad range
of context on which to establish subsequent conversations at the event.</p><p>View session notes

wrote down (and shared with OONI) their desired next steps for
continuing collaboration after the meeting.</p><h1 id=inclusiveness>Inclusiveness</h1><p>The OONI Partner Gathering was committed to providing a safe and
welcoming environment for discussing issues related to internet
censorship.</p><p>Given that participants came from more than 10 different countries and
cultures, and from a diverse set of backgrounds, it was imperative to us
that the event was as inclusive as possible to encourage participation,
and to ensure a pleasant and fruitful experience for all.</p><p>To this end, we shared the event’s <a href=https://github.com/OpenObservatory/gatherings/tree/master/partner-gatherings/2017-07-toronto>Code of Conduct</a>
with all participants prior to the event, and discussed it as part of
the Opening Plenary. We set up an Incident Response Committee,
comprising of two partners and one OONI team member, but no violations
were reported.</p><p>We formed the agenda based on suggestions and requests made by
participants prior and during the event. All sessions included small
groups, to encourage more participation.</p><p>As the OONI project uses a lot of specialized technical terminology and
participants came from a diverse set of backgrounds (including lawyers,
policy researchers, and human rights advocates), we set up a glossary
that was populated with terms during both days of the event.</p><p><img src=/post/ooni-partner-gathering-2017/07.jpg alt="OONI Partner Gathering"></p><p>We encouraged participants to write terms in the glossary whose meaning
they weren’t sure of. We plan to create an online glossary on our
website soon, which would include (hopefully) easy-to-understand
descriptions of the terms pointed out as part of the OONI Partner
Gathering, as well as other terms that community members bring to our
attention.</p><h1 id=challenges-and-needs>Challenges and needs</h1><p>One of the core objectives of the OONI Partner Gathering was to gain a
better understanding of the challenges that our partners have
encountered over the last year and their associated needs. This would
inform the development of our tools and methodologies, improving upon
our collaboration on the study of internet censorship moving forward.</p><p>The table below summarizes the main partner challenges and associated
needs that were identified as part of this event.</p><table><thead><tr><th></th><th style=text-align:center>Challenges</th><th style=text-align:right>Needs</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td style=text-align:center>Hard to use GitHub to contribute to <a href=https://github.com/citizenlab/test-lists/tree/master/lists>test lists</a></td><td style=text-align:right>Web platform to easily contribute to test lists (without using GitHub)</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td style=text-align:center>Testing URLs other than those included in test lists</td><td style=text-align:right>Web platform to easily submit URLs for testing (without using GitHub)</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td style=text-align:center>Choosing the types/categories of URLs to test (currently that requires passing your own list via the command line)</td><td style=text-align:right>Web platform that allows users to choose which types/categories of URLs to test (e.g. excluding pornography which may be illegal)</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td style=text-align:center>Running OONI Probe on desktop platforms (still requires some use of terminal, despite web UI)</td><td style=text-align:right>Desktop applications for OONI Probe that are easy to install and use</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td style=text-align:center>Many community members interested in running OONI Probe are Windows users (OONI Probe is not currently available for Windows)</td><td style=text-align:right>Windows application for OONI Probe that is easy to install and use</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td style=text-align:center>Setting up and configuring OONI Probe on Raspberry Pis</td><td style=text-align:right>Easier way of setting up and configuring OONI Probe on Raspberry Pis</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td style=text-align:center>Trust (i.e. hard to gain the trust of new members to run OONI Probe)</td><td style=text-align:right>Strategies for building trust across community networks (through regional workshops, for example)</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td style=text-align:center>Apathy (Who cares?

the OONI Partner Gathering, will inform (many of) the goals and
priorities of our collaboration moving forward.</p><p>Some of our <em>high priority goals</em> over the next two years, with the aim
of addressing the challenges and needs of our community members, include
the following:</p><p><strong>1. Making OONI Probe easier to install and run across more platforms</strong></p><p>To enable our partners to engage more community members with the use of
OONI Probe and to subsequently expand the global coverage of censorship
events, we aim to make OONI Probe as easy to use as possible. To this
end, we aim to create native OONI Probe apps for Windows and macOS,
particularly since many community members around the world are Windows
users. We will also continue to improve upon our mobile apps and
distribution for Raspberry Pis based on community feedback.</p><p><strong>2. Improving upon our data analysis techniques and creating a
Censorship Alert System</strong></p><p>To enable rapid response to emergent censorship events by policy and
advocacy groups in our community, we aim to improve upon our data
analysis capabilities to detect censorship events around the world
faster and more accurately. We also aim to create a Censorship Alert
System that will disseminate timely alerts of emergent censorship events
to community members.</p><p><strong>3. Expanding our methodologies to examine more forms of internet
censorship</strong></p><p>To support the work of advocacy groups (such as the <a href=https://www.accessnow.org/keepiton/>KeepItOn campaign</a>, which includes some of
our partners), we aim to develop a methodology for the automatic
detection and examination of internet blackouts around the world.</p><p>As part of the OONI Partner Gathering, we facilitated <a href=https://github.com/OpenObservatory/gatherings/tree/master/partner-gatherings/2017-07-toronto/session-notes>two sessions on measuring internet blackouts</a>,
and we identified the next steps for our experimentation. We also plan
to expand our methodologies to measure more forms of internet
censorship, such as throttling.</p><p><strong>4. Expanding our partnerships to empower censorship research
participation around the world</strong></p><p>OONI has been a community-driven project since the very beginning and
moving forward, we aim to de-centralize the project even more.</p><p>By expanding our partnerships, we aim to foster cross-community
collaboration, and to engage more groups with the study of internet
censorship around the world. This would lead to stable network
measurements being collected from more local vantage points, the review
of more test lists, and the publication of more research reports in
collaboration with partners (who provide extremely valuable local
expertise and knowledge).</p><p>The expansion of OONI’s community can also help decentralize the
analysis of OONI data, and engage more policy and advocacy groups. It
can also help foster regional and local workshops (for community
engagement, discussing choices and potential risks), and other related
activities (such as the much needed localization of materials).</p><p>In addition to all of the above, we would also like to achieve the
following:</p><ul><li><p>Creating a web platform that is synchronized with git, through which
community members can easily contribute to test lists;</p></li><li><p>Enabling users to choose which URLs (and which categories of URLs)
to test directly through the OONI Probe mobile and desktop apps
(thus limiting potential associated risk);</p></li><li><p>Improving upon OONI Explorer to export csv files, filter confirmed
censorship cases vs. anomalous measurements, expose top censorship
findings per country, and potentially export graphs and data
visualizations;</p></li><li><p>Engaging community members with the creation of a wiki database that
can help provide context around network measurement data around
the world (this was discussed more thoroughly as part of a <a href=https://citizenlab.ca/summerinstitute/2017.html>CLSI</a>
session that we facilitated).</p></li><li><p>Creating educational materials (e.g. animations,
videos, visualizations) that can help explain OONI Probe tests and
why measuring internet censorship matters.</p></li></ul><h1 id=outcomes>Outcomes</h1><p>The main outcomes of the OONI Partner Gathering can be summarized as
follows:</p><ul><li><p>We collected <strong>feedback</strong> from our partners that will help inform
the development of our tools and methodologies;</p></li><li><p>Participants acquired new skills and knowledge related to measuring
internet censorship (as detailed through the <a href=https://github.com/OpenObservatory/gatherings/tree/master/partner-gatherings/2017-07-toronto/session-notes>session notes</a>);</p></li><li><p>We gained a better understanding of the <strong>challenges</strong> that our
partners have encountered over the last year and we brainstormed
on solutions for addressing them;</p></li><li><p>We gained a better understanding of our partners’ <strong>needs</strong>, based
on which we will tailor the development of our tools and
methodologies, and our overall collaboration moving forward;</p></li><li><p>We specified the next steps for creating a methodology for the
examination of internet blackouts (through the <a href=https://github.com/OpenObservatory/gatherings/tree/master/partner-gatherings/2017-07-toronto/session-notes>sessions on measuring internet blackouts</a>);</p></li><li><p>We determined our <strong>goals and priorities</strong> for the next two years
based on partner needs and feedback;</p></li><li><p>Our partners had the opportunity to potentially form regional
(or cross-regional) collaborations amongst them;</p></li><li><p>The event enabled the OONI team to meet its partners in real life
and to bond more (thus enabling stronger partnerships
moving forward).</p></li></ul><h1 id=acknowledgements>Acknowledgements</h1><p>The OONI team would like to send a warm <strong>thank you</strong> to all of the
participants who took time out of their busy schedules to fly across the
world to join us in Toronto. Thanks to your invaluable feedback and
participation, you made the first OONI Partner Gathering a success.</p><p>We would also like to thank all of our other partners and community
members who unfortunately weren’t able to join us, but who play a
significant role in increasing transparency of internet censorship on a
daily basis. The world needs more people like you.</p><p>Finally, we would like to thank the <a href=https://www.opentech.fund/>Open Technology Fund (OTF)</a>, the <a href=https://www.fordfoundation.org/>Ford Foundation</a>, and the <a href=http://mediademocracyfund.org/>Media Democracy Fund (MDF)</a> for supporting the event.
