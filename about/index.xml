You may find details on what exactly it is that we measure by reading through our test specifications. The data we collect is then made available to the public for further analysis.
The goal of this study is to have a better understanding on how the internet works around the world and what is stopping it from working as it should.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://ooni.github.io/about/inform-users-short/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ooni.github.io/about/inform-users-short/</guid><description>WARNING: Running OONI may be against the terms of service of your ISP or legally questionable in your country.
