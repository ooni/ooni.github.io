&lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-46938679">erupted&lt;/a> in Zimbabwe
in response to the government’s announcement that the price of fuel
would more than double. According to Zimbabwe’s government, the price
hikes &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-46878267">aim&lt;/a> to avert
fuel shortages and to crackdown on the illegal trading of fuel. The new
prices, however, mean that Zimbabwe now has the &lt;a href="https://www.globalpetrolprices.com/gasoline_prices/World-top10/">most expensive fuel&lt;/a>
in the world.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Zimbabwe’s fuel protests lasted for three days (14th to 17th January
2019), during which 12 people were
&lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-46938679">reportedly&lt;/a> killed
and many more beaten by security forces. It is estimated that 78 people
were &lt;a href="http://www.hrforumzim.org/news/on-the-days-of-darkness-in-zimbabwe/">treated for gunshot wounds&lt;/a>,
while hundreds of protesters were
&lt;a href="http://www.hrforumzim.org/news/zimshutdown-violations-updates/">arrested&lt;/a>
by the police.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
