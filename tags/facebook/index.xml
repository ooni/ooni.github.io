(OONI)&lt;/a> project is excited to announce the release
of &lt;em>two&lt;/em> new software tests which are designed to examine the blocking of
&lt;strong>WhatsApp&lt;/strong> and &lt;strong>Facebook Messenger&lt;/strong>. You can now run these tests to monitor the
accessibility of these apps across time, and to collect data that can serve as
evidence when/if they are blocked.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="whatsapp-test">WhatsApp test&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Many of our users have asked us to develop a test to examine the accessibility
of WhatsApp, especially in light of it being &lt;a href="https://ooni.org/post/brazil-whatsapp-block/">blocked&lt;/a> by various governments
around the world during elections, protests, and other political events.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
