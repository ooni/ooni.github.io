(followed by many strong aftershocks) struck (southern and central)
Turkey and (northern and western) Syria, resulting in more than 36,000
deaths.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the aftermath of the earthquake (on 8th February 2023), access to
Twitter was
&lt;a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2023/02/08/tech/turkey-twitter-restriction/index.html">reportedly&lt;/a>
temporarily restricted. OONI data collected from Turkey provides
evidence that the block was implemented through targeted throttling and
DNS interference.&lt;/p>

We analysed data about this that we collected with RIPE Atlas and the Open Observatory of Network Interference (OONI).&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On 15 July, a coup was attempted in Turkey. We heard about social media being throttled and/or blocked, but much was unclear about what was actually going on. Here we present measurement data from various platforms that shared their data publicly.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
