&lt;p>In March 2020, Internet Service Providers (ISPs) in Myanmar received a
directive from the Ministry of Transport and Communications to &lt;a href="https://www.telenor.com.mm/en/article/blocking-230-websites-myanmar-based-directive-authorities">block 230 websites&lt;/a>,
most of which contain adult content. However, 67 of these sites were
blocked on the grounds of spreading “fake news”. The list of these 230
websites has not been published.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In an attempt to potentially identify the newly blocked websites, we
analyzed &lt;a href="https://explorer.ooni.org/country/MM">OONI network measurements collected from Myanmar&lt;/a> over the last months,
between 1st January 2020 to 9th April 2020.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Let's measure the accessibility of COVID-19 websites around the world</title><link>https://ooni.github.io/post/covid-19-ooni-measurement/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ooni.github.io/post/covid-19-ooni-measurement/</guid><description>&lt;p>Ensuring a free and open internet during an emergency, like the current
&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/events-as-they-happen">COVID-19 pandemic&lt;/a>,
is more important than ever. However, access to information related to
the coronavirus pandemic has already been censored by certain
governments. &lt;a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2020/03/censored-contagion-how-information-on-the-coronavirus-is-managed-on-chinese-social-media/">China censored information on the coronavirus&lt;/a>
on Chinese social media platforms, while &lt;a href="https://vesinfiltro.com/noticias/bloqueado_portal_coronavirus_AN">Venezuela’s state-owned CANTV blocked access to a coronavirus information portal&lt;/a>
last week.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We therefore invite you to participate in a measurement campaign to
check if COVID-19 sites are accessible in your country (and on the
network you’re using) and to &lt;a href="https://explorer.ooni.org/">share relevant measurement data&lt;/a> with the world.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
