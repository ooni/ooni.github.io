internet censorship in Southeast Asia and Hong Kong (China) in collaboration with their
&lt;a href="https://imap.sinarproject.org/">Internet Monitoring and Action Project (iMAP)&lt;/a> partners. We are particularly
excited about these reports as they make use of &lt;a href="https://ooni.org/data">OONI data&lt;/a>!&lt;/p>

Once, there was no nationwide internet censorship until the latest development that local authorities and Beijing forcefully implemented the Hong Kong national security law in late June 2020. Currently, at least four websites are known to be censored, and a few ongoing discussions among pro-Beijing parties and the government to put censorship up on instant messaging and social platforms.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
