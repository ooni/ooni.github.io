Amid the protests, access to major social media platforms was &lt;a href="https://www.turkiyetoday.com/turkiye/social-media-access-restricted-in-turkiye-amid-political-developments-133004">reportedly interfered with&lt;/a> in Türkiye.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this report, we present OONI data and findings from our investigation into the &lt;strong>throttling of social media platforms&lt;/strong> across various networks in Türkiye during March and September 2025, periods when interference with these platforms was reported. Specifically, OONI data suggests that access to Twitter/X, Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, YouTube, TikTok, and Signal was throttled, whereas access to Telegram was blocked. Additionally, &lt;a href="https://explorer.ooni.org/search?since=2025-03-19&amp;until=2025-03-20&amp;failure=false&amp;domain=www.youtube.com&amp;probe_cc=TR&amp;probe_asn=AS12735&amp;only=confirmed">YouTube was blocked via DNS on TurkNet (AS12735)&lt;/a>. Details are shared below.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Turkey: Throttling and DNS blocking of Twitter following deadly earthquake</title><link>https://ooni.github.io/post/2023-turkey-throttling-blocking-twitter/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ooni.github.io/post/2023-turkey-throttling-blocking-twitter/</guid><description>&lt;p>On 6th February 2023, a &lt;a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2023/02/13/middleeast/turkey-earthquake-building-construction-intl/index.html">devastating 7.8-magnitude earthquake&lt;/a>
(followed by many strong aftershocks) struck (southern and central)
Turkey and (northern and western) Syria, resulting in more than 36,000
deaths.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the aftermath of the earthquake (on 8th February 2023), access to
Twitter was
&lt;a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2023/02/08/tech/turkey-twitter-restriction/index.html">reportedly&lt;/a>
temporarily restricted. OONI data collected from Turkey provides
evidence that the block was implemented through targeted throttling and
DNS interference.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>As abortion remains partially or totally
&lt;a href="https://reproductiverights.org/worldabortionlaws">criminalized&lt;/a> in
numerous countries, the fight to promote sexual and reproductive rights,
as well as women&amp;rsquo;s health, also relies on access to information. But
recently, we were told that the website of the abortion rights
non-governmental organization womeonwaves.org, which provides
reproductive health services and education to women in countries with
restrictive abortion laws, was inaccessible in Brazil.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Internet Access Disruption in Turkey - July 2016</title><link>https://ooni.github.io/post/turkey-internet-access-disruption/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Jul 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ooni.github.io/post/turkey-internet-access-disruption/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>With the attempted coup in Turkey, reports went out about social media being throttled and/or blocked.

&lt;p>On 15 July, a coup was attempted in Turkey. We heard about social media being throttled and/or blocked, but much was unclear about what was actually going on. Here we present measurement data from various platforms that shared their data publicly.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
