whether internet censorship events were occurring in the country. Hundreds of
thousands of &lt;a href="https://explorer.ooni.org/country/KE">network measurements&lt;/a> were collected and analyzed. &lt;a href="https://github.com/citizenlab/test-lists/tree/master/lists">1,357 URLs&lt;/a> were
tested for censorship, including both &lt;a href="https://github.com/citizenlab/test-lists/blob/master/lists/global.csv">international websites&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://github.com/citizenlab/test-lists/blob/master/lists/ke.csv">sites that are more relevant to Kenya&lt;/a> (e.g. local news outlets). Yet, after five months of
intensive testing from four local vantage points in Kenya, we found almost no
signs of internet censorship in the country.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
