Elmenhorst&amp;rsquo;s QUIC-and-HTTP/3 censorship research as part of her &lt;a href="https://www.opentech.fund/about/people/kathrin-elmenhorst/">ICFP fellowship
with OONI&lt;/a>.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Last year, the new network protocol &lt;strong>QUIC&lt;/strong> was introduced. QUIC
is a general-purpose transport layer network with the goal of
reducing latency compared to existing protocols. Since the introduction
of QUIC, we have seen rising volumes of QUIC-based web traffic in
the form of &lt;strong>HTTP/3&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As QUIC usage increases, it has become theÂ target of censorship
efforts. From the perspective of censors, the emergence of QUIC and
HTTP/3 means two things:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Measuring HTTP/3 censorship with OONI Probe</title><link>https://ooni.github.io/post/2022-http3-measurements-paper/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ooni.github.io/post/2022-http3-measurements-paper/</guid><description>&lt;p>Last year, QUIC emerged as a new internet protocol for creating reliable connections and encrypting communications between clients over the new HTTP/3 protocol. Observing the emergence and growing deployment of HTTP/3, we want to enable &lt;a href="https://ooni.org/install/">OONI Probe&lt;/a> to measure HTTP/3 censorship and monitor how censors respond and adapt to technical innovation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We therefore added HTTP/3 support (in early 2021) into &lt;a href="https://ooni.org/install/">OONI Probe&lt;/a> (through our &lt;a href="https://github.com/ooni/spec/blob/master/nettests/ts-027-urlgetter.md">urlgetter&lt;/a> research tool) to conduct measurements in &lt;strong>China, Iran, India and Kazakhstan to investigate the state of HTTP/3 censorship&lt;/strong> in these countries.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
