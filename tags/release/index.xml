the beta release of OONI Probe&amp;rsquo;s distribution for Raspberry Pis, caÄºled
&lt;strong>Lepidopter&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-is-lepidopter">What is Lepidopter&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Lepidopter is a Raspberry Pi distribution image with all the required
dependencies and software packages in place, configured to run network
measurement tests via the
&lt;a href="https://github.com/TheTorProject/ooni-probe">OONI Probe&lt;/a> software. It is
developed and designed to require no physical attendance upon first bootstrap
but also allows experienced users to further configure it as they wish. The
&lt;a href="https://github.com/TheTorProject/lepidopter">source code&lt;/a> and the building
scripts of the Lepidopter image are free and open source software.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>OONI releases new Web Connectivity test for detecting online censorship</title><link>https://ooni.github.io/post/web-connectivity/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Jun 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ooni.github.io/post/web-connectivity/</guid><description>&lt;p>Today the Open Observatory of Network Interference (OONI) is excited to be
releasing a brand new test, called
&lt;em>&lt;a href="https://ooni.org/nettest/web-connectivity/">Web Connectivity&lt;/a>&lt;/em>,
which is designed to detect three different types of censorship: &lt;em>DNS
tampering&lt;/em>, &lt;em>TCP/IP blocking&lt;/em> and &lt;em>HTTP blocking&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="advantages-of-running-web-connectivity">Advantages of running Web Connectivity&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This test allows us to see which websites are blocked and how, more accurately
than ever before!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Previously we relied on running separate (http_request, dns_consistency and
tcp_connect) tests with the aim of identifying various forms of censorship. We
then had to correlate measurements across different tests to identify whether
and how websites were blocked. This process was not only tedious, but it also
led to more false positives.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
