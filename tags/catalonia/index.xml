&lt;p>Image: Catalan Independence Referendum site seized&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Two days ago, Catalonia held a
&lt;a href="http://time.com/4951665/catalan-referendum-2017/">referendum&lt;/a> seeking
independence from Spain. As the world awaits to see what happens next,
we publish this post to share
&lt;a href="https://api.ooni.io/files/by_country/ES">evidence&lt;/a> of recent
censorship events that occurred during and leading up to the referendum.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We &lt;strong>confirm the blocking of at least 25 sites related to the Catalan
referendum&lt;/strong> by means of DNS tampering and HTTP blocking, based on
&lt;a href="https://explorer.ooni.org/country/ES">OONI Probe network measurements&lt;/a>
collected from three local networks. OONI data shows that these sites
were blocked every day from (at least) 25th September 2017 (when the
testing started) leading up to the referendum day, on 1st October 2017.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
