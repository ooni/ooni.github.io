&lt;a href="https://www.womenonweb.org">www.womenonweb.org&lt;/a> has been
blocked in Spain over the last months by several local Internet Service
Providers (ISPs). Once Spanish hacktivist communities noticed that
&lt;a href="http://www.womenonweb.org">www.womenonweb.org&lt;/a> was
inaccessible, they coordinated on running &lt;a href="https://ooni.org/install/">OONI
Probe&lt;/a> tests to collect
measurement data that could serve as evidence. The findings of this
investigation have been published in &lt;a href="https://blog.magma.lavafeld.org/post/women-on-web-blocking/">an excellent
report&lt;/a>,
whose writing was coordinated by our former colleague, Vasilis Ververis.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We were involved in the technical review of the report. We found their
methodology particularly interesting. They used the OONI &lt;a href="https://ooni.org/nettest/web-connectivity/">Web
Connectivity experiment&lt;/a>
along with OONI&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://ooni.org/post/2020-iran-sni-blocking/">experimental SNI based blocking
methodology&lt;/a>,
and they also performed manual experiments with
&lt;a href="https://www.openssl.org/">OpenSSL&lt;/a> and
&lt;a href="https://curl.haxx.se/">cURL&lt;/a>. Because OONI&amp;rsquo;s mission is
to simplify and automate the collection of censorship evidence, we are
always interested in learning how we can expand &lt;a href="https://ooni.org/nettest/web-connectivity/">our Web Connectivity
methodology&lt;/a> to
automatically gather more data that is useful in specific cases.
Coincidentally, as part of &lt;a href="https://github.com/ooni/probe-engine/issues/40">rewriting the Web Connectivity
implementation in Go&lt;/a>, we
have already written experimental code that combines &lt;a href="https://ooni.org/nettest/web-connectivity/">vanilla Web
Connectivity&lt;/a>
with &lt;a href="https://ooni.org/post/2020-iran-sni-blocking/">SNI blocking&lt;/a>
and other techniques. We therefore asked them to run this experimental
code with &lt;a href="https://www.womenonweb.org">www.womenonweb.org&lt;/a>
as a target. Our goal was to evaluate whether our working prototype
would have allowed them to obtain the same research results, without
resorting to manually running specifically tailored network experiments.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
