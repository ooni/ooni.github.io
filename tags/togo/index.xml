were held in Togo. These elections follow a &lt;a href="https://www.acleddata.com/2018/12/13/togo-another-wave-of-demonstrations-washes-over-gnassingbes-regime/">wave of protests&lt;/a>
over the last years against the 53-year rule of Gnassingbe Eyadema and,
subsequently, his son, Faure Gnassingbe. A few days before the election,
non-partisan election monitoring was restricted as &lt;a href="https://www.ndi.org/publications/statement-expulsion-ndi-staff-togo-and-restrictions-election-monitoring">National Democratic Institute (NDI) staff were expelled&lt;/a>
from the country. According to preliminary results from the electoral
commission, incumbent President Faure Gnassingbe &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-51606972">won re-election&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

internet during the elections (similarly to other West African
countries, such as

encouraging the government of Togo to ensure a free and open internet
during the election. Access Now also &lt;a href="https://www.accessnow.org/togo-election-2020/">encouraged the use of OONI Probe&lt;/a> so that locals in
Togo could monitor the accessibility of online sites and services
