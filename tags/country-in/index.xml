internet censorship in Southeast Asia and Hong Kong (China) in collaboration with their
&lt;a href="https://imap.sinarproject.org/">Internet Monitoring and Action Project (iMAP)&lt;/a> partners. These reports are based on &lt;a href="https://ooni.org/data">OONI data&lt;/a> collected between July 2023 to June 2024 from 9 countries: Cambodia, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://imap.sinarproject.org/about">Internet Monitoring Action Project (iMAP)&lt;/a> aims to establish regional
and in-country networks that monitor network interference and

&lt;p>This is a &lt;strong>guest post by &lt;a href="https://thebachchaoproject.org/">The Bachchao Project&lt;/a>&lt;/strong>, originally published

&lt;hr>
&lt;p>The &lt;a href="https://thebachchaoproject.org/">Bachchao Project&lt;/a> in partnership with &lt;a href="https://ooni.org/">OONI&lt;/a> hosted an online event on 9th and
10th October 2021 to update the &lt;a href="https://github.com/citizenlab/test-lists/blob/master/lists/in.csv">Citizen Lab test list for India&lt;/a>. The event,
which was called “India, Lets build the list”, was organised to help strengthen
community based monitoring of internet censorship in India. The event allowed
experts from different fields to contribute to a curated &lt;a href="https://github.com/citizenlab/test-lists/blob/master/lists/in.csv">list of websites&lt;/a> that
are relevant to India and which are regularly tested for censorship by
volunteers in India.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Investigating Encrypted DNS Blocking in India</title><link>https://ooni.github.io/post/2020-encrypted-dns-blocking-india/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ooni.github.io/post/2020-encrypted-dns-blocking-india/</guid><description>&lt;p>In October 2020, we collaborated with Divyank Katira and Gurshabad Grover,
researchers at the &lt;a href="https://cis-india.org/">Centre for Internet &amp;amp; Society, India&lt;/a>,
to implement and evaluate a new OONI experiment focused on detecting DNS censorship.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This new OONI experiment, called &lt;a href="https://github.com/ooni/probe-engine/tree/v0.19.0/experiment/dnscheck">dnscheck&lt;/a>,
focuses on detecting the blocking of encrypted DNS
transports such as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_over_TLS">DNS over TLS&lt;/a>
and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_over_HTTPS">DNS over HTTPS&lt;/a>. Its
methodology improves upon the measurement methodology OONI previously used to measure
&lt;a href="https://ooni.org/post/2020-iran-dot">DoT blocking in Iran&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The implementation, &lt;a href="https://github.com/ooni/probe-engine/pull/950">written by Divyank Katira&lt;/a>, is currently only available
to users of the &lt;a href="https://github.com/ooni/probe-engine/tree/v0.19.0#building-miniooni">miniooni&lt;/a>
research client. We are however &lt;a href="https://github.com/ooni/probe/issues/1262">planning on promoting the dsncheck experiment
as a first class experiment&lt;/a> that will run
by default as part of the &amp;ldquo;websites&amp;rdquo; experiments group.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Investigating TLS blocking in India</title><link>https://ooni.github.io/post/2020-tls-blocking-india/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ooni.github.io/post/2020-tls-blocking-india/</guid><description>&lt;p>This report investigates Transport Layer Security
(&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security">TLS&lt;/a>)-based
blocking in India. &lt;a href="https://cis-india.org/internet-governance/blog/reliance-jio-is-using-sni-inspection-to-block-websites">Previous
research&lt;/a>
by the &lt;a href="https://cis-india.org/">Centre for Internet &amp;amp;
Society, India&lt;/a> (CIS) has already
exposed TLS blocking based on the value of the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication">SNI
field&lt;/a>.
OONI has also &lt;a href="https://ooni.org/post/2020-iran-sni-blocking/">implemented and started
testing&lt;/a>
SNI-based TLS blocking measurements.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Recently, the Magma Project
&lt;a href="https://blog.magma.lavafeld.org/post/women-on-web-blocking/">documented&lt;/a>
cases where CIS India and OONI&amp;rsquo;s methodologies could be improved. They
specifically found that blocking sometimes appears to depend not only on
the value of the SNI field but also on the address of the web server
being used. These findings were later confirmed by OONI measurements in
&lt;a href="https://ooni.org/post/2020-engine-evaluation-spain">Spain&lt;/a>
and &lt;a href="https://ooni.org/post/2020-iran-dot/">Iran&lt;/a> through
the use of an extended measurement methodology.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
