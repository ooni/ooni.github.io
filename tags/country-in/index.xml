Observing the emergence and growing deployment of HTTP/3, we want to enable &lt;a href="https://ooni.org/install/">OONI Probe&lt;/a> to measure HTTP/3 censorship and monitor how censors respond and adapt to technical innovation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We therefore added HTTP/3 support (in early 2021) into &lt;a href="https://ooni.org/install/">OONI Probe&lt;/a> (through our &lt;a href="https://github.com/ooni/spec/blob/master/nettests/ts-027-urlgetter.md">urlgetter&lt;/a> research tool) to conduct measurements in &lt;strong>China, Iran, India and Kazakhstan to investigate the state of HTTP/3 censorship&lt;/strong> in these countries.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>.com/citizenlab/test-lists/blob/master/lists/in.csv">list of websites&lt;/a> that

researchers at the &lt;a href="https://cis-india.org/">Centre for Internet &amp;amp; Society, India&lt;/a>,
to implement and evaluate a new OONI experiment focused on detecting DNS censorship.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This new OONI experiment, called &lt;a href="https://github.com/ooni/probe-engine/tree/v0.19.0/experiment/dnscheck">dnscheck&lt;/a>,
focuses on detecting the blocking of encrypted DNS
transports such as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_over_TLS">DNS over TLS&lt;/a>
and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_over_HTTPS">DNS over HTTPS&lt;/a>. Its
methodology improves upon the measurement methodology OONI previously used to measure
&lt;a href="https://ooni.org/post/2020-iran-dot">DoT blocking in Iran&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The implementation, &lt;a href="https://github.com/ooni/probe-engine/pull/950">written by Divyank Katira&lt;/a>, is currently only available
to users of the &lt;a href="https://github.com/ooni/probe-engine/tree/v0.19.0#building-miniooni">miniooni&lt;/a>
research client. We are however &lt;a href="https://github.com/ooni/probe/issues/1262">planning on promoting the dsncheck experiment
as a first class experiment&lt;/a> that will run
by default as part of the &amp;ldquo;websites&amp;rdquo; experiments group.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Investigating TLS blocking in India</title><link>https://ooni.github.io/post/2020-tls-blocking-india/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ooni.github.io/post/2020-tls-blocking-india/</guid><description>&lt;p>This report investigates Transport Layer Security
(&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security">TLS&lt;/a>)-based
blocking in India. &lt;a href="https://cis-india.org/internet-governance/blog/reliance-jio-is-using-sni-inspection-to-block-websites">Previous
research&lt;/a>
by the &lt;a href="https://cis-india.org/">Centre for Internet &amp;amp;
Society, India&lt;/a> (CIS) has already
exposed TLS blocking based on the value of the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication">SNI
field&lt;/a>.
OONI has also &lt;a href="https://ooni.org/post/2020-iran-sni-blocking/">implemented and started
testing&lt;/a>
SNI-based TLS blocking measurements.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Recently, the Magma Project
&lt;a href="https://blog.magma.lavafeld.org/post/women-on-web-blocking/">documented&lt;/a>
cases where CIS India and OONI&amp;rsquo;s methodologies could be improved. They
specifically found that blocking sometimes appears to depend not only on
the value of the SNI field but also on the address of the web server
being used. These findings were later confirmed by OONI measurements in
&lt;a href="https://ooni.org/post/2020-engine-evaluation-spain">Spain&lt;/a>
and &lt;a href="https://ooni.org/post/2020-iran-dot/">Iran&lt;/a> through
the use of an extended measurement methodology.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
