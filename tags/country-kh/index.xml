News and other websites are periodically blocked in Cambodia, particularly those that disseminate information that could be perceived as a threat to the ruling government.1 In July 2018, the government ordered internet service providers (ISPs) to block at least 15 news websites during the country’s election.2 In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, the government has reportedly blocked access to news sites.3 In June 2020, the Ministry of Post telecommunications (MPTC) blocked six online gambling sites.</description></item></channel></rss>
