&lt;p>Two days ago, on 26th April 2023, Brazil started &lt;a href="https://explorer.ooni.org/chart/mat?probe_cc=BR&amp;since=2023-03-29&amp;until=2023-04-29&amp;time_grain=day&amp;axis_x=measurement_start_day&amp;test_name=telegram">blocking&lt;/a> access to Telegram.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the same day, a federal judge in Brazil &lt;a href="https://www.dw.com/en/brazil-court-orders-temporary-suspension-of-telegram-over-neo-nazi-probe/a-65446224">reportedly&lt;/a> ordered the temporary suspension of Telegram in response to the messaging service’s alleged failure to share all information on neo-Nazi chat groups requested by the police. This information was &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/26/briefing/brazil-telegram-ban.html">reportedly&lt;/a> requested as part of a school attacks inquiry, as Brazilian authorities investigate neo-Nazi groups that are believed to have used Telegram to incite school attacks. However, Telegram’s CEO &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2023/04/27/telegram-brazil-block/2ec1c1de-e554-11ed-9696-8e874fd710b8_story.html">claims&lt;/a> (&lt;a href="https://web.telegram.org/z/#-1006503122">on his Telegram channel&lt;/a>) that it’s impossible for them to comply with the order, as the judge requested data that is not feasible for them to obtain.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ethiopia: From internet blackouts to the blocking of WhatsApp and Telegram</title><link>https://ooni.github.io/post/ethiopia-whatsapp-telegram/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ooni.github.io/post/ethiopia-whatsapp-telegram/</guid><description>&lt;p>Communication access in Ethiopia has significantly been disrupted over the last week. Internet access and Short Message Services (SMS) were &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/save/https://twitter.com/addisstandard/status/1139127606211727360">disconnected&lt;/a> intermittently across the country.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>During the first half of the week, internet connectivity was &lt;a href="https://ioda.caida.org/ioda/dashboard#view=inspect&amp;entity=country/ET&amp;lastView=overview&amp;from=1560166834&amp;until=now">shut down completely&lt;/a>.
