releasing a brand new test, called
&lt;em>&lt;a href="https://ooni.org/nettest/web-connectivity/">Web Connectivity&lt;/a>&lt;/em>,
which is designed to detect three different types of censorship: &lt;em>DNS
tampering&lt;/em>, &lt;em>TCP/IP blocking&lt;/em> and &lt;em>HTTP blocking&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="advantages-of-running-web-connectivity">Advantages of running Web Connectivity&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This test allows us to see which websites are blocked and how, more accurately
than ever before!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Previously we relied on running separate (http_request, dns_consistency and
tcp_connect) tests with the aim of identifying various forms of censorship. We
then had to correlate measurements across different tests to identify whether
and how websites were blocked. This process was not only tedious, but it also
led to more false positives.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
