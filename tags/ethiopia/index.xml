anti-government protests, access to social media platforms (TikTok,
Facebook, Telegram) was &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/ethiopias-social-media-blocked-amid-church-split-tensions/2023/02/10/15781c44-a93d-11ed-b2a3-edb05ee0e313_story.html">reportedly blocked&lt;/a>
in Ethiopia. Access Now also published a
&lt;a href="https://www.accessnow.org/ethiopia-social-media-protest/">statement&lt;/a>
urging authorities in Ethiopia to stop blocking access to social media.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>OONI data collected from Ethiopia provides signals of these blocks.
Specifically, OONI data shows the ongoing blocking of

&lt;p>On 22nd June 2018, the Ethiopian government &lt;a href="http://www.africanews.com/2018/06/23/ethiopia-unblocks-264-websites-and-tv-channels/">reported&lt;/a> that it had unblocked 264 websites. This (great) news was also &lt;a href="https://ethsat.com/2018/06/ethiopia-unblocks-264-websites-including-esat/">reported by ESAT&lt;/a>, a major Ethiopian media website that was &lt;a href="https://explorer.ooni.io/measurement/20160817T192345Z_AS24757_vkmTFvmkOUzdotRJrOUrieRB5bqhrEUjem5G2ZnQqDbfRByV2U?input=http:%2F%2Fethsat.com">blocked&lt;/a> over the last years.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Recently we published a &lt;a href="https://ooni.org/post/ethiopia-internet-shutdown-amidst-recent-protests/">post&lt;/a> about what appeared to be a possible internet
shutdown in Ethiopia during a wave of ongoing protests by ethnic groups. Today,
in collaboration with &lt;a href="https://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International&lt;/a> we are releasing a report that
includes evidence of recent censorship events during Ethiopia’s political
upheaval.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>See the &lt;a href="https://ooni.github.io/post/ethiopia-report/amharic-translation.pdf">Amharic translation&lt;/a> of the report. Translated by Wolete Mariam.&lt;/p>

&lt;a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-37015055">reported&lt;/a> in Ethiopia over the
last days, as part of protests against the marginalization and persecution of
the Oromos and Amharas, Ethiopia’s two largest ethnic groups. But the attacks
and arrests may not have been the only forms of retribution carried out by the
Ethiopian government in its crackdown against protesters.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Last weekend, the internet was
&lt;a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-36940906">reportedly&lt;/a> shut down in the
country.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In an attempt to understand whether the internet was in fact shut down, we
looked at some public sources of data that contain information about internet
traffic. Such data provides strong indicators that the internet was most likely
shut down during the Ethiopian protests last weekend, though it remains unclear
if this occurred in all regions and/or on all types of networks across the
country.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
