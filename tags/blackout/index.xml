Myanmar experienced unprecedented levels of internet censorship.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In response, we collaborated with CAIDA’s &lt;a href="https://ooni.org/partners/ioda/">Internet Outage Detection and Analysis (IODA)&lt;/a> team and
&lt;a href="https://ooni.org/partners/mido/">Myanmar ICT for Development Organization (MIDO)&lt;/a> on publishing a &lt;a href="https://ooni.org/post/2021-myanmar-internet-blocks-and-outages/">research report&lt;/a>
which documents a &lt;a href="https://ooni.org/post/2021-myanmar-internet-blocks-and-outages/#internet-outages">series of nightly internet outages&lt;/a>
and the
&lt;a href="https://ooni.org/post/2021-myanmar-internet-blocks-and-outages/#findings">blocking&lt;/a>
of social media, Wikipedia, and circumvention tool sites in Myanmar
following the military coup.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the months that followed, we continued to examine internet censorship
in Myanmar quite closely. We collaborated with
&lt;a href="https://ioda.caida.org/">IODA&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://www.kentik.com/">Kentik&lt;/a>,
and other researchers from &lt;a href="https://ucsd.edu/">UC San Diego&lt;/a> and the
&lt;a href="https://umich.edu/">University of Michigan&lt;/a> to expand our analysis.
We used diverse datasets and measurement methods to offer a holistic
view into the censorship events in Myanmar that occurred since the coup
and show how internet censorship &lt;em>evolved&lt;/em> between &lt;strong>1st February 2021
to 30th April 2021&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Investigating Internet shutdowns through Mozilla telemetry</title><link>https://ooni.github.io/post/2021-investigating-internet-shutdowns-mozilla-telemetry/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ooni.github.io/post/2021-investigating-internet-shutdowns-mozilla-telemetry/</guid><description>&lt;p>More than &lt;a href="https://data.firefox.com/dashboard/user-activity">200 million users&lt;/a> worldwide use
the &lt;a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/">Firefox&lt;/a> web browser
(developed by Mozilla) every month.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If access to the Internet is shut down in a country, Mozilla should
expect to see a dramatic drop in Firefox usage from that country. Given
how &lt;a href="https://data.firefox.com/dashboard/user-activity">widespread&lt;/a> the
use of Firefox is around the world, could Mozilla telemetry be a
valuable resource for the Internet freedom community to investigate
Internet shutdowns?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To explore this question, the &lt;a href="https://ooni.org/">Open Observatory of Network Interference (OONI)&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://ioda.caida.org/">Internet Outage Detection and Analysis (IODA)&lt;/a> teams joined forces to analyze a
dataset of potential outage signals gathered through regular Mozilla
telemetry, access to which was provided by Mozilla as part of a relevant
research project to validate assumptions about the data.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Myanmar: Data on internet blocks and internet outages following military coup</title><link>https://ooni.github.io/post/2021-myanmar-internet-blocks-and-outages/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ooni.github.io/post/2021-myanmar-internet-blocks-and-outages/</guid><description>&lt;p>On 1st February 2021, the military in Myanmar carried out a &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-55882489">coup d’etat&lt;/a>, seizing power
and detaining the country’s State Counsellor (equivalent to a prime
minister) and other democratically elected leaders.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A few days after the coup, ISPs in Myanmar started &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-myanmar-politics-facebook-idUSKBN2A32ZE">blocking access to Facebook services&lt;/a>.
On 5th February 2021, they started &lt;a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2021/02/05/tech/myanmar-blocks-twitter-instagram/index.html">blocking access to Twitter and Instagram&lt;/a>
as well. On 6th February 2021, access to &lt;a href="https://ioda.caida.org/ioda/dashboard#view=inspect&amp;entity=country/MM&amp;lastView=overview&amp;from=1612437274&amp;until=1612782874">the internet was shut down entirely for nearly 30 hours&lt;/a>.
When internet connectivity was restored, social media blocks remained in
place and they are currently ongoing. Since 15th February 2021, access
to the internet has been &lt;a href="https://ioda.caida.org/ioda/dashboard#view=inspect&amp;entity=country/MM&amp;lastView=overview&amp;from=1613219264&amp;until=1614774464">shut down every night&lt;/a>
(between around 1am to 9am local time) in Myanmar. More recently, some
ISPs in Myanmar appear to have started &lt;a href="https://explorer.ooni.org/search?since=2021-02-01&amp;probe_cc=MM&amp;test_name=web_connectivity&amp;domain=www.wikipedia.org&amp;until=2021-03-05">blocking access to Wikipedia&lt;/a>
as well.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Uganda: Data on internet blocks and nationwide internet outage amid 2021 general election</title><link>https://ooni.github.io/post/2021-uganda-general-election-blocks-and-outage/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ooni.github.io/post/2021-uganda-general-election-blocks-and-outage/</guid><description>&lt;p>Last week, amid its &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-55573581">2021 general election&lt;/a>, Uganda was
&lt;a href="https://ioda.caida.org/ioda/dashboard#view=inspect&amp;entity=country/UG&amp;lastView=overview&amp;from=-1w&amp;until=now">disconnected&lt;/a>
from the internet entirely. The country experienced a &lt;a href="https://www.accessnow.org/the-world-is-watching-uganda-elections/">widespread internet blackout that lasted 4 days&lt;/a>,
starting on the eve of the election (13th January 2021) and ending in
the morning of 18th January 2021. In the days leading up to the
election, access to major social media platforms and circumvention tools
was &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/MTNUG/posts/5644233898936144">blocked&lt;/a>
&amp;ndash; &lt;em>even when the &lt;a href="https://www.mtn.co.ug/product/ott-tax/">OTT (Over the Top) tax&lt;/a> (commonly referred to as
the “Social Media Tax”) was paid&lt;/em>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Internet disruption in Gabon amid coup attempt</title><link>https://ooni.github.io/post/gabon-internet-disruption/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Jan 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ooni.github.io/post/gabon-internet-disruption/</guid><description>&lt;p>On 7th January 2019, a &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-46779854">military coup was attempted in Gabon&lt;/a> in a bid to end
more than 50 years of rule by President Ali Bongo’s family. The coup
attempt was quickly foiled. Security forces
&lt;a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/01/gabon-coup-attempt-foiled-190107131011483.html">reportedly&lt;/a>
killed two suspects, arrested seven others, and Gabon’s government
retained control.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Meanwhile, a &lt;a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/01/gabon-coup-attempt-foiled-190107131011483.html">curfew&lt;/a>
has been imposed and &lt;a href="https://netblocks.org/reports/evidence-of-gabon-full-internet-shutdown-coup-attempt-dQ8oo18n">NetBlocks reported&lt;/a>
that access to the Internet has been shut down.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this post, we share data that provides signals of network disruptions
in Gabon.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Examining internet blackouts through public data sources</title><link>https://ooni.github.io/post/examining-internet-blackouts/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Mar 2017 16:39:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ooni.github.io/post/examining-internet-blackouts/</guid><description>&lt;p>Pulling the plug on the internet is one of the ways that governments around the

&lt;p>While the &lt;a href="https://ooni.org/">Open Observatory of Network Interference (OONI)&lt;/a> project has developed numerous &lt;a href="https://github.com/TheTorProject/ooni-probe">software tests&lt;/a> for examining different
forms of internet censorship (such as the blocking of websites, instant
messaging apps, and censorship circumvention tools), we currently do not have
tests that are designed to examine internet blackouts, when the internet as a
whole is rendered inaccessible within a location.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
