&lt;p>The northeastern Indian state of Manipur has long been an area of conflict and
crackdowns. But although human rights violations are &lt;a href="https://www.hrw.org/report/2008/09/29/these-fellows-must-be-eliminated/relentless-violence-and-impunity-manipur">well documented&lt;/a> in the
state, few studies have examined the impact of censorship and internet shutdowns
in the region. In 2019, research fellow Chinmayi S K sought to address this
critical gap by documenting the blocking of websites in Manipur and assessing
how the use of information controls in the state compares to that in the rest of
India. Of particular note, the in-depth research project studied the impact of
online censorship on the identities, livelihoods, and activities of womxn living
in Manipur.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
