&lt;p>Imagine a day where the internet is shut down completely. You have to
work, check the news, and communicate with your friends and family. All
of a sudden, you can’t do any of that, because there simply is no
internet. It feels like a strange form of time travel has taken place:
you’re thrown several decades into the past, into a world without
internet, but in one which has learned to heavily rely on it. And
sometimes, you remain in that world for several days (or
&lt;a href="https://qz.com/964927/caemroons-internet-shutdown-is-over-after-93-days/">months&lt;/a>,
in the case of the anglophone region of Cameroon). None of this makes
sense, and there’s no clear justification for it either.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
