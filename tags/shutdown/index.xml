&lt;p>This report shares empirical technical findings on the recent Internet
shutdown events that emerged in Iran following the death of Jhina
(Mahsa) Amini in September 2022. The report is intended to be the first
among a series of multi-stakeholder reports aimed at shedding light on
what is becoming a widespread and increasingly sophisticated practice of
certain governments around the world. The stakeholders participating in
the report share a concern about the global trend in Internet shutdowns,
but are contributing to the analysis only on the basis of their
technical expertise.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Investigating Internet shutdowns through Mozilla telemetry</title><link>https://ooni.github.io/post/2021-investigating-internet-shutdowns-mozilla-telemetry/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ooni.github.io/post/2021-investigating-internet-shutdowns-mozilla-telemetry/</guid><description>&lt;p>More than &lt;a href="https://data.firefox.com/dashboard/user-activity">200 million users&lt;/a> worldwide use
the &lt;a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/">Firefox&lt;/a> web browser
(developed by Mozilla) every month.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If access to the Internet is shut down in a country, Mozilla should
expect to see a dramatic drop in Firefox usage from that country. Given
how &lt;a href="https://data.firefox.com/dashboard/user-activity">widespread&lt;/a> the
use of Firefox is around the world, could Mozilla telemetry be a
valuable resource for the Internet freedom community to investigate
Internet shutdowns?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To explore this question, the &lt;a href="https://ooni.org/">Open Observatory of Network Interference (OONI)&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://ioda.caida.org/">Internet Outage Detection and Analysis (IODA)&lt;/a> teams joined forces to analyze a
dataset of potential outage signals gathered through regular Mozilla
telemetry, access to which was provided by Mozilla as part of a relevant
research project to validate assumptions about the data.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Examining internet blackouts through public data sources</title><link>https://ooni.github.io/post/examining-internet-blackouts/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Mar 2017 16:39:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ooni.github.io/post/examining-internet-blackouts/</guid><description>&lt;p>Pulling the plug on the internet is one of the ways that governments around the
world attempt to exert control over the flow of information.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While the &lt;a href="https://ooni.org/">Open Observatory of Network Interference (OONI)&lt;/a> project has developed numerous &lt;a href="https://github.com/TheTorProject/ooni-probe">software tests&lt;/a> for examining different
forms of internet censorship (such as the blocking of websites, instant
messaging apps, and censorship circumvention tools), we currently do not have
tests that are designed to examine internet blackouts, when the internet as a
whole is rendered inaccessible within a location.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Gambia: Internet Shutdown during 2016 Presidential Election</title><link>https://ooni.github.io/post/gambia-internet-shutdown/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Dec 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ooni.github.io/post/gambia-internet-shutdown/</guid><description>&lt;p>Last week we attempted to perform &lt;a href="https://github.com/TheTorProject/ooni-probe">OONI network measurement tests&lt;/a> in the Gambia
to examine whether websites were blocked during its 2016 presidential election.
But merely a few hours after we connected our probe to perform tests, it stopped
working completely.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We suspected that this was due to an internet shutdown. To confirm this, we
referred to third-party data to examine whether a country-wide internet blackout
was taking place.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this report, we summarize some of our key findings pertaining to the internet
shutdown that appears to have occurred in the Gambia on the eve of its 2016
presidential election.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ethiopia: Internet Shutdown Amidst Recent Protests?</title><link>https://ooni.github.io/post/ethiopia-internet-shutdown-amidst-recent-protests/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Aug 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ooni.github.io/post/ethiopia-internet-shutdown-amidst-recent-protests/</guid><description>&lt;p>Nearly 100 deaths and thousands of arrests have been
&lt;a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-37015055">reported&lt;/a> in Ethiopia over the
last days, as part of protests against the marginalization and persecution of
the Oromos and Amharas, Ethiopiaâ€™s two largest ethnic groups. But the attacks
and arrests may not have been the only forms of retribution carried out by the
Ethiopian government in its crackdown against protesters.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Last weekend, the internet was
&lt;a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-36940906">reportedly&lt;/a> shut down in the
country.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In an attempt to understand whether the internet was in fact shut down, we
looked at some public sources of data that contain information about internet
traffic. Such data provides strong indicators that the internet was most likely
shut down during the Ethiopian protests last weekend, though it remains unclear
if this occurred in all regions and/or on all types of networks across the
country.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
