&lt;p>As a response to the Russian aggression against Ukraine, the European Union (EU) imposed sanctions on organisations affiliated with the Russian Federation prohibiting them from broadcasting content in the EU, including online distribution. In a collaborative effort with researchers from the University of Illinois Chicago, Open Observatory of Network Interference (OONI), the University of Twente and the University of Amsterdam, we carried out a longitudinal traffic analysis to understand how internet service providers (ISPs) in different EU member states implement these sanctions. We found that the degree of blocking varies widely, both between and within individual EU member states. This raises questions about the effectiveness of the EU sanctions. This blog is a summary of the paper we published last month.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Launch: New OONI Censorship Findings platform</title><link>https://ooni.github.io/post/2023-launch-ooni-censorship-findings-platform/</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ooni.github.io/post/2023-launch-ooni-censorship-findings-platform/</guid><description>&lt;p>

&lt;strong>Image:&lt;/strong> OONI Censorship Findings platform.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Today we are thrilled to announce the launch of the OONI &lt;a href="https://explorer.ooni.org/findings">Censorship
Findings&lt;/a> platform!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Internet censorship is frequently being reported around the world, but
how can we verify such events with empirical evidence?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our &lt;a href="https://explorer.ooni.org/findings">new platform provides short reports&lt;/a> on internet censorship around the world based on OONI&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://ooni.org/data/">open data&lt;/a>. With the launch of the platform, we are &lt;strong>publishing 20 reports on internet censorship&lt;/strong> that emerged in 2023. In response to emergent censorship events, this
platform will be updated with new reports on an ongoing basis.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
