hood, your web browser resolves the &lt;code>example.com&lt;/code> domain to one or
more IP addresses using the Domain Name System (DNS), a set of
federated servers and protocols providing this name-to-IP-address
mapping. For example, as of 2022-06-16, &lt;code>example.com&lt;/code> resolves to
the &lt;code>93.184.216.34&lt;/code> (IPv4) and &lt;code>2606:2800:220:1:248:1893:25c8:1946&lt;/code>
(IPv6) addresses. Once it knows the IP addresses for the domain,
the browser then uses them to fetch the requested webpage. Conceptually,
the browser tries the IP addresses in sequence until it finds one
that works. If no returned IP address works, the request fails.
Therefore, domain name lookups are key to browsing and, incidentally,
are also key to website censorship and surveillance.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Measuring HTTP/3 censorship with OONI Probe</title><link>https://ooni.github.io/post/2022-http3-measurements-paper/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ooni.github.io/post/2022-http3-measurements-paper/</guid><description>&lt;p>Last year, QUIC emerged as a new internet protocol for creating reliable connections and encrypting communications between clients over the new HTTP/3 protocol. Observing the emergence and growing deployment of HTTP/3, we want to enable &lt;a href="https://ooni.org/install/">OONI Probe&lt;/a> to measure HTTP/3 censorship and monitor how censors respond and adapt to technical innovation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We therefore added HTTP/3 support (in early 2021) into &lt;a href="https://ooni.org/install/">OONI Probe&lt;/a> (through our &lt;a href="https://github.com/ooni/spec/blob/master/nettests/ts-027-urlgetter.md">urlgetter&lt;/a> research tool) to conduct measurements in &lt;strong>China, Iran, India and Kazakhstan to investigate the state of HTTP/3 censorship&lt;/strong> in these countries.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A multi-perspective view of Internet censorship in Myanmar</title><link>https://ooni.github.io/post/2021-multiperspective-view-internet-censorship-myanmar/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ooni.github.io/post/2021-multiperspective-view-internet-censorship-myanmar/</guid><description>&lt;p>In the wake of a &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-55882489">military coup&lt;/a> in February 2021,
Myanmar experienced unprecedented levels of internet censorship.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In response, we collaborated with CAIDAâ€™s &lt;a href="https://ooni.org/partners/ioda/">Internet Outage Detection and Analysis (IODA)&lt;/a> team and
&lt;a href="https://ooni.org/partners/mido/">Myanmar ICT for Development Organization (MIDO)&lt;/a> on publishing a &lt;a href="https://ooni.org/post/2021-myanmar-internet-blocks-and-outages/">research report&lt;/a>
which documents a &lt;a href="https://ooni.org/post/2021-myanmar-internet-blocks-and-outages/#internet-outages">series of nightly internet outages&lt;/a>
and the
&lt;a href="https://ooni.org/post/2021-myanmar-internet-blocks-and-outages/#findings">blocking&lt;/a>
of social media, Wikipedia, and circumvention tool sites in Myanmar
following the military coup.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the months that followed, we continued to examine internet censorship
in Myanmar quite closely. We collaborated with
&lt;a href="https://ioda.caida.org/">IODA&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://www.kentik.com/">Kentik&lt;/a>,
and other researchers from &lt;a href="https://ucsd.edu/">UC San Diego&lt;/a> and the
&lt;a href="https://umich.edu/">University of Michigan&lt;/a> to expand our analysis.
We used diverse datasets and measurement methods to offer a holistic
view into the censorship events in Myanmar that occurred since the coup
and show how internet censorship &lt;em>evolved&lt;/em> between &lt;strong>1st February 2021
to 30th April 2021&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
