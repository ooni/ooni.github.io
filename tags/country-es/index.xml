&lt;p>Information controls are known to occur during conflicts, and that’s exactly what we’re seeing in Russia following the recent invasion of Ukraine on 24th February 2022.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In recent days, &lt;a href="https://explorer.ooni.org/search?since=2022-02-04&amp;until=2022-03-07&amp;failure=false&amp;probe_cc=RU">OONI network measurement data&lt;/a> collected from Russia shows that many Internet Service Providers (ISPs) have started &lt;a href="https://explorer.ooni.org/search?since=2022-02-04&amp;until=2022-03-07&amp;failure=false&amp;probe_cc=RU&amp;test_name=web_connectivity&amp;only=anomalies">blocking&lt;/a> access to several news media websites, as well as to a &lt;a href="https://explorer.ooni.org/search?since=2022-02-04&amp;until=2022-03-07&amp;failure=false&amp;probe_cc=RU&amp;test_name=web_connectivity&amp;only=anomalies&amp;domain=200rf.com">website&lt;/a> (200rf.com) that shares information about captured and killed Russian soldiers in Ukraine. OONI data also shows that Russian ISPs started &lt;a href="https://explorer.ooni.org/search?since=2022-02-26&amp;until=2022-03-04&amp;failure=false&amp;domain=twitter.com&amp;probe_cc=RU">throttling access to Twitter&lt;/a> on 26th February 2022, and switched to &lt;a href="https://explorer.ooni.org/measurement/20220306T202033Z_webconnectivity_RU_51604_n1_oVoIGdnUmlxCWmyR?input=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2F">blocking&lt;/a> it by 4th March 2022 – at which point, they also started &lt;a href="https://explorer.ooni.org/search?since=2022-02-04&amp;until=2022-03-07&amp;failure=false&amp;domain=www.facebook.com&amp;probe_cc=RU&amp;only=anomalies">blocking access to Facebook&lt;/a>. Censorship in Russia is generally implemented in a &lt;a href="https://www.ndss-symposium.org/ndss-paper/decentralized-control-a-case-study-of-russia/">decentralized&lt;/a> way, as blocks are not observed on all networks, while ISPs adopt a variety of different censorship techniques.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Evaluating OONI’s New Measurement Engine in the Context of the Blocking of Women on Web in Spain</title><link>https://ooni.github.io/post/2020-engine-evaluation-spain/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ooni.github.io/post/2020-engine-evaluation-spain/</guid><description>&lt;p>Reproduction rights site
&lt;a href="https://www.womenonweb.org">www.womenonweb.org&lt;/a> has been
blocked in Spain over the last months by several local Internet Service
Providers (ISPs). Once Spanish hacktivist communities noticed that
&lt;a href="http://www.womenonweb.org">www.womenonweb.org&lt;/a> was
inaccessible, they coordinated on running &lt;a href="https://ooni.org/install/">OONI
Probe&lt;/a> tests to collect
measurement data that could serve as evidence. The findings of this
investigation have been published in &lt;a href="https://blog.magma.lavafeld.org/post/women-on-web-blocking/">an excellent
report&lt;/a>,
whose writing was coordinated by our former colleague, Vasilis Ververis.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We were involved in the technical review of the report. We found their
methodology particularly interesting. They used the OONI &lt;a href="https://ooni.org/nettest/web-connectivity/">Web
Connectivity experiment&lt;/a>
along with OONI&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://ooni.org/post/2020-iran-sni-blocking/">experimental SNI based blocking
methodology&lt;/a>,
and they also performed manual experiments with
&lt;a href="https://www.openssl.org/">OpenSSL&lt;/a> and
&lt;a href="https://curl.haxx.se/">cURL&lt;/a>. Because OONI&amp;rsquo;s mission is
to simplify and automate the collection of censorship evidence, we are
always interested in learning how we can expand &lt;a href="https://ooni.org/nettest/web-connectivity/">our Web Connectivity
methodology&lt;/a> to
automatically gather more data that is useful in specific cases.
Coincidentally, as part of &lt;a href="https://github.com/ooni/probe-engine/issues/40">rewriting the Web Connectivity
implementation in Go&lt;/a>, we
have already written experimental code that combines &lt;a href="https://ooni.org/nettest/web-connectivity/">vanilla Web
Connectivity&lt;/a>
with &lt;a href="https://ooni.org/post/2020-iran-sni-blocking/">SNI blocking&lt;/a>
and other techniques. We therefore asked them to run this experimental
code with &lt;a href="https://www.womenonweb.org">www.womenonweb.org&lt;/a>
as a target. Our goal was to evaluate whether our working prototype
would have allowed them to obtain the same research results, without
resorting to manually running specifically tailored network experiments.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Evidence of Internet Censorship during Catalonia's Independence Referendum</title><link>https://ooni.github.io/post/internet-censorship-catalonia-independence-referendum/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Oct 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ooni.github.io/post/internet-censorship-catalonia-independence-referendum/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img alt="Seized referendum site" src="https://ooni.github.io/post/catalonia/seized.png">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Image: Catalan Independence Referendum site seized&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Two days ago, Catalonia held a
&lt;a href="http://time.com/4951665/catalan-referendum-2017/">referendum&lt;/a> seeking
independence from Spain. As the world awaits to see what happens next,
we publish this post to share
&lt;a href="https://api.ooni.io/files/by_country/ES">evidence&lt;/a> of recent
censorship events that occurred during and leading up to the referendum.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We &lt;strong>confirm the blocking of at least 25 sites related to the Catalan
referendum&lt;/strong> by means of DNS tampering and HTTP blocking, based on
&lt;a href="https://explorer.ooni.org/country/ES">OONI Probe network measurements&lt;/a>
collected from three local networks. OONI data shows that these sites
were blocked every day from (at least) 25th September 2017 (when the
testing started) leading up to the referendum day, on 1st October 2017.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
