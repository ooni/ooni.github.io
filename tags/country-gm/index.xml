to examine whether websites were blocked during its 2016 presidential election.
But merely a few hours after we connected our probe to perform tests, it stopped
working completely.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We suspected that this was due to an internet shutdown. To confirm this, we
referred to third-party data to examine whether a country-wide internet blackout
was taking place.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this report, we summarize some of our key findings pertaining to the internet
shutdown that appears to have occurred in the Gambia on the eve of its 2016
presidential election.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
