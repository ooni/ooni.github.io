to discuss the changing landscape for internet infrastructure and
technology in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As part of our preparation for this webinar, we looked at network
performance measurements collected from northern Italy over the last
months (i.e. when Italy was hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic) in an
attempt to understand whether and to what extent there was a correlation
between increased internet use and reduced network performance. As our
observations may be of public interest, we decided to share them through
this blog post.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
