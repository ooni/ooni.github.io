&lt;p>The &lt;a href="https://thebachchaoproject.org/">Bachchao Project&lt;/a> in partnership with &lt;a href="https://ooni.org/">OONI&lt;/a> hosted an online event on 9th and
10th October 2021 to update the &lt;a href="https://github.com/citizenlab/test-lists/blob/master/lists/in.csv">Citizen Lab test list for India&lt;/a>. The event,
which was called “India, Lets build the list”, was organised to help strengthen
community based monitoring of internet censorship in India. The event allowed
experts from different fields to contribute to a curated &lt;a href="https://github.com/citizenlab/test-lists/blob/master/lists/in.csv">list of websites&lt;/a> that
are relevant to India and which are regularly tested for censorship by
volunteers in India.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
