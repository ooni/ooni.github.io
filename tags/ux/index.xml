To enable community members to more effectively useOONI Run, we researched its limitations and collected structured community feedback through an OONI Run usability study.
This report outlines the objectives, personas, assumptions, and methods of this study.
We also share the outcomes based on the analysis of information collected through oursurveyand interviews with community members, as well as some of the next steps towards improving OONI Run.</description></item><item><title>Do you use OONI Probe?
