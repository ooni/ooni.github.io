that some OONI measurements were available on &lt;a href="https://explorer.ooni.org/">OONI Explorer&lt;/a> under a report ID containing a
valid &lt;a href="https://ooni.org/support/glossary/#asn">Autonomous System Number (ASN)&lt;/a>, even though the raw
JSON data contained zero as the ASN (i.e. encoded as &lt;code>AS0&lt;/code>). We
initially thought that this was caused by a bug in our API code, but it
actually turned out to be an &lt;a href="https://ooni.org/install/">OONI Probe&lt;/a>
bug in our &lt;a href="https://github.com/ooni/probe-engine">probe engine&lt;/a> (which
powers the OONI Probe apps).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Please &lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://ooni.org/install/mobile">update your OONI Probe mobile app to the latest version (2.7.0)&lt;/a>&lt;/strong>, which fixes this bug.
If you are an OONI Probe desktop app user and prefer not to share your
network ASN, please refrain from running tests until we have released a
fix for OONI Probe desktop (&lt;a href="https://github.com/ooni/explorer/issues/495#issuecomment-705518245">hopefully this will be possible next week&lt;/a>).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>OONI Probe Android 2.0.0 Incident Report</title><link>https://ooni.github.io/post/ooni-probe-android-200-incident/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Feb 2019 23:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ooni.github.io/post/ooni-probe-android-200-incident/</guid><description>&lt;p>The first public release of OONI Probe Android 2.0.0 (since 2.0.0-alpha.7) included a very serious bug: we lost measurements and collected measurements that we shouldnâ€™t have. As soon as the problem was identified, we quickly released a fix (OONI Probe Android 2.0.1). All measurements that should not have been uploaded have been deleted and we are working on a new OONI Probe release (OONI Probe Mobile 2.1.0) that will allow you to manually re-upload measurements. No other OONI Probe platforms (&lt;a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id1199566366">iOS&lt;/a>, [macOS](&lt;a href="https://ooni.io/install/OONI">https://ooni.io/install/OONI&lt;/a> Probe), [Linux](&lt;a href="https://ooni.io/install/OONI">https://ooni.io/install/OONI&lt;/a> Probe), &lt;a href="https://ooni.io/install/lepidopter/">Lepidopter&lt;/a>) were affected.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
