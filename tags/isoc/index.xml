&lt;p>With Internet shutdowns, disruptions and censorship events on the increase
around the world, tracking where such events are happening and gathering
evidence to help in the fight against them is becoming more and more
important.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Tracking these events is crucial because of the impact they have on society and
the economy. When social media apps are blocked, for example, freedom of
speech, access to information, and movement-building is hampered. When access
to the Internet is shut down completely, people may not have access to vital
services or be able to work and study.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
