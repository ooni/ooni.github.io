&lt;p>Two days ago, on 26th April 2023, Brazil started &lt;a href="https://explorer.ooni.org/chart/mat?probe_cc=BR&amp;since=2023-03-29&amp;until=2023-04-29&amp;time_grain=day&amp;axis_x=measurement_start_day&amp;test_name=telegram">blocking&lt;/a> access to Telegram.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the same day, a federal judge in Brazil &lt;a href="https://www.dw.com/en/brazil-court-orders-temporary-suspension-of-telegram-over-neo-nazi-probe/a-65446224">reportedly&lt;/a> ordered the temporary suspension of Telegram in response to the messaging service’s alleged failure to share all information on neo-Nazi chat groups requested by the police. This information was &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/26/briefing/brazil-telegram-ban.html">reportedly&lt;/a> requested as part of a school attacks inquiry, as Brazilian authorities investigate neo-Nazi groups that are believed to have used Telegram to incite school attacks. However, Telegram’s CEO &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2023/04/27/telegram-brazil-block/2ec1c1de-e554-11ed-9696-8e874fd710b8_story.html">claims&lt;/a> (&lt;a href="https://web.telegram.org/z/#-1006503122">on his Telegram channel&lt;/a>) that it’s impossible for them to comply with the order, as the judge requested data that is not feasible for them to obtain.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>On the blocking of abortion rights websites: Women on Waves &amp; Women on Web</title><link>https://ooni.github.io/post/2019-blocking-abortion-rights-websites-women-on-waves-web/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ooni.github.io/post/2019-blocking-abortion-rights-websites-women-on-waves-web/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img alt="Cover image" src="https://ooni.github.io/post/2019-blocking-abortion-rights-websites-women-on-waves-web/wow-cover-image.png">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>As abortion remains partially or totally
&lt;a href="https://reproductiverights.org/worldabortionlaws">criminalized&lt;/a> in
numerous countries, the fight to promote sexual and reproductive rights,
as well as women&amp;rsquo;s health, also relies on access to information. But
recently, we were told that the website of the abortion rights
non-governmental organization womeonwaves.org, which provides
reproductive health services and education to women in countries with
restrictive abortion laws, was inaccessible in Brazil.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>OONI Data Reveals How WhatsApp Was Blocked (Again) in Brazil</title><link>https://ooni.github.io/post/brazil-whatsapp-block/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 May 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ooni.github.io/post/brazil-whatsapp-block/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Country:&lt;/strong> Brazil&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Ever since &lt;a href="https://www.whatsapp.com/security/">WhatsApp implemented end-to-end
encryption&lt;/a> to protect the privacy and
security of its 1 billion users worldwide, several cases of censorship have
been ordered by governments who are frustrated with the fact that they can no
longer access users&amp;rsquo; private communications. Having implemented end-to-end
encryption with the Signal protocol, WhatsApp cannot decrypt its users&amp;rsquo; data,
even if it wanted to - which is precisely what makes it secure.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
