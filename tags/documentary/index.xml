landscape. We spent most of our time hopping from one public WiFi hotspot to
another, measuring networks in Havana, Santa Clara, and Santiago de Cuba. You
might remember that we published a &lt;a href="https://ooni.org/post/cuba-internet-censorship-2017/">research report&lt;/a> on our findings.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Today we publish a &lt;strong>short documentary (“ParkNet”)&lt;/strong> on our study of internet
censorship in Cuba.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>“ParkNet” is a term that we coined to refer to parks that serve as public WiFi
hotspots in Cuba. You can also access the internet from many other public
spaces, but we found parks to be particularly interesting due to the sort of
collective experience that they offer when &amp;ldquo;visiting” the internet.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
