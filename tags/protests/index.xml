&lt;p>This report shares empirical technical findings on the recent Internet
shutdown events that emerged in Iran following the death of Jhina
(Mahsa) Amini in September 2022. The report is intended to be the first
among a series of multi-stakeholder reports aimed at shedding light on
what is becoming a widespread and increasingly sophisticated practice of
certain governments around the world. The stakeholders participating in
the report share a concern about the global trend in Internet shutdowns,
but are contributing to the analysis only on the basis of their
technical expertise.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Iran blocks social media, app stores and encrypted DNS amid Mahsa Amini protests</title><link>https://ooni.github.io/post/2022-iran-blocks-social-media-mahsa-amini-protests/</link><pubDate>Sun, 25 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ooni.github.io/post/2022-iran-blocks-social-media-mahsa-amini-protests/</guid><description>&lt;p>Protests &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/17/iran-protests-death-kurdish-woman-mahsaa-amini-morality-police">erupted&lt;/a> in Iran over the last week following the death of Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old Kurdish woman who was reportedly beaten to death by Iran’s morality police for allegedly violating strict hijab rules. Amid the &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-62994003">ongoing protests&lt;/a>, which have &lt;a href="https://iranhr.net/fa/articles/5496/">reportedly&lt;/a> resulted in at least 31 civilian deaths, Iranian authorities &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/22/iran-blocks-capitals-internet-access-as-amini-protests-grow">cracked down on the internet&lt;/a> in an attempt to curb dissent.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>More than 70 websites have been &lt;a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/08/28/belarus-internet-disruptions-online-censorship">blocked&lt;/a>
in Belarus over the last weeks, following a &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/aug/10/its-outrageous-belarus-election-result-sparks-night-of-defiance-and-violence">controversial presidential election&lt;/a>
and amid &lt;a href="https://time.com/5880593/belarus-protests-lukashenko/">ongoing anti-government protests&lt;/a>. Many
of the blocked sites include news media and are related to the
elections, while several other sites expressing political criticism were
blocked as well. At the time of writing, many of these sites remain
blocked in Belarus.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ethiopia: From internet blackouts to the blocking of WhatsApp and Telegram</title><link>https://ooni.github.io/post/ethiopia-whatsapp-telegram/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ooni.github.io/post/ethiopia-whatsapp-telegram/</guid><description>&lt;p>Communication access in Ethiopia has significantly been disrupted over the last week.

&lt;p>During the first half of the week, internet connectivity was &lt;a href="https://ioda.caida.org/ioda/dashboard#view=inspect&amp;entity=country/ET&amp;lastView=overview&amp;from=1560166834&amp;until=now">shut down completely&lt;/a>.

&lt;p>Recently we published a &lt;a href="https://ooni.org/post/ethiopia-internet-shutdown-amidst-recent-protests/">post&lt;/a> about what appeared to be a possible internet
shutdown in Ethiopia during a wave of ongoing protests by ethnic groups. Today,
in collaboration with &lt;a href="https://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International&lt;/a> we are releasing a report that
includes evidence of recent censorship events during Ethiopia’s political
upheaval.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>See the &lt;a href="https://ooni.github.io/post/ethiopia-report/amharic-translation.pdf">Amharic translation&lt;/a> of the report. Translated by Wolete Mariam.&lt;/p>

&lt;a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-37015055">reported&lt;/a> in Ethiopia over the
last days, as part of protests against the marginalization and persecution of
the Oromos and Amharas, Ethiopia’s two largest ethnic groups. But the attacks
and arrests may not have been the only forms of retribution carried out by the
Ethiopian government in its crackdown against protesters.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Last weekend, the internet was
&lt;a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-36940906">reportedly&lt;/a> shut down in the
country.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In an attempt to understand whether the internet was in fact shut down, we
looked at some public sources of data that contain information about internet
traffic. Such data provides strong indicators that the internet was most likely
shut down during the Ethiopian protests last weekend, though it remains unclear
if this occurred in all regions and/or on all types of networks across the
country.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
